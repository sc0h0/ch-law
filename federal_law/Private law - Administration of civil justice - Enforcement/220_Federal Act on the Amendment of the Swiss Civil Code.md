1 Where the parties have agreed on all the essential terms, it is presumed that the contract will be binding notwithstanding any reservation on secondary terms.

2 In the event of failure to reach agreement on such secondary terms, the court must determine them with due regard to the nature of the transaction.

3 The foregoing is subject to the provisions governing the form of contracts.

1 A person who offers to enter into a contract with another person and sets a time limit for acceptance is bound by his offer until the time limit expires.

1 Where an offer is made in the offeree’s presence and no time limit for acceptance is set, it is no longer binding on the offeror unless the offeree accepts it immediately.

2 Contracts concluded by telephone are deemed to have been concluded in the parties’ presence where they or their agents communicated in person.

## [b. In the parties’ absence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 5**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_5)

1 Where an offer is made in the offeree’s absence and no time limit for acceptance is set, it remains binding on the offeror until such time as he might expect a reply sent duly and promptly to reach him.

2 He may assume that his offer has been promptly received.

3 Where an acceptance sent duly and promptly is late in reaching the offeror and he does not wish to be bound by his offer, he must immediately inform the offeree.

## [3. Implied acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 6**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_6)

Where the particular nature of the transaction or the circumstances are such that express acceptance cannot reasonably be expected, the contract is deemed to have been concluded if the offer is not rejected within a reasonable time.

## [3*a*. Unsolicited goods](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3_a)

###### [**Art. 6***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_6_a)

## [4. Non-binding offer, announcement of prices, display](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 7**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_7)

1 An offeror is not bound by his offer if he has made express declaration to that effect or such a reservation arises from the circumstances or from the particular nature of the transaction.

2 The sending of tariffs, price lists and the like does not constitute an offer.

3 By contrast, the display of merchandise with an indication of its price does generally constitute an offer.

## [5. Publicly promised remuneration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_5)

2 If he withdraws his promise before performance has been made, he must reimburse any person incurring expenditure in good faith on account of the promise up to the maximum amount promised unless he can prove that such person could not have provided the performance in question.

## [6. Withdrawal of offer and acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_6)

###### [**Art. 9**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_9)

1 An offer is deemed not to have been made if its withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer itself or, where it arrives subsequently, if it is communicated to the offeree before he becomes aware of the offer.

2 The same applies to a withdrawal of an acceptance.

## [III. Entry into effect of a contract concluded in the parties’ absence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 10**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_10)

## [I. Formal requirements and significance in general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 11**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_11)

1 The validity of a contract is not subject to compliance with any particular form unless a particular form is prescribed by law.

2 In the absence of any provision to the contrary on the significance and effect of formal requirements prescribed by law, the contract is valid only if such requirements are satisfied.

## [II. Written form](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

## [a. Scope](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 12**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_12)

Where the law requires that a contract be done in writing, the requirement also applies to any amendment to the contract with the exception of supplementary collateral clauses that do not conflict with the original document.

## [b. Effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 14**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_14)

1 Signatures must be appended by hand by the parties to the contract.

2 A signature reproduced by mechanical means is recognised as sufficient only where such reproduction is customarily permitted, and in particular in the case of signatures on large numbers of issued securities.

2bis An authenticated electronic signature combined with an authenticated time stamp within the meaning of the Federal Act of 18 March 2016 on Electronic Signatures is deemed equivalent to a handwritten signature, subject to any statutory or contractual provision to the contrary.

3 The signature of a blind person is binding only if it has been duly certified or if it is proved that he was aware of the terms of the document at the time of signing.

## [d. Mark in lieu of signature](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_d)

###### [**Art. 15**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_15)

Subject to the provisions relating to bills of exchange, any person unable to sign may make a duly certified mark by hand or give a certified declaration in lieu of a signature.

## [2. Form stipulated by contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 16**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_16)

1 Where the parties agree to make a contract subject to formal requirements not prescribed by law, it is presumed that the parties do not wish to assume obligations until such time as those requirements are satisfied.

2 Where the parties stipulate a written form without elaborating further, the provisions governing the written form as required by law apply to satisfaction of that requirement.

## [C. Cause of obligation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_C)

###### [**Art. 17**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_17)

An acknowledgment of debt is valid even if it does not state the cause of the obligation.

## [D. Interpretation of contracts, simulation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_D)

###### [**Art. 18**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_18)

1 When assessing the form and terms of a contract, the true and common intention of the parties must be ascertained without dwelling on any inexact expressions or designations they may have used either in error or by way of disguising the true nature of the agreement.

2 A debtor may not plead simulation as a defence against a third party who has become his creditor in reliance on a written acknowledgment of debt.

## [E. Terms of the contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_E)

## [I. Definition of terms](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 19**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_19)

1 The terms of a contract may be freely determined within the limits of the law.

2 Clauses that deviate from those prescribed by law are admissible only where the law does not prescribe mandatory forms of wording or where deviation from the legally prescribed terms would contravene public policy, morality or rights of personal privacy.

## [II. Nullity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 20**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_20)

1 A contract is void if its terms are impossible, unlawful or immoral.

2 However, where the defect pertains only to certain terms of a contract, those terms alone are void unless there is cause to assume that the contract would not have been concluded without them.

## [III. Unfair advantage](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 21**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_21)

1 Where there is a clear discrepancy between performance and consideration under a contract concluded as a result of one party’s exploitation of the other’s straitened circumstances, inexperience or thoughtlessness, the person suffering damage may declare within one year that he will not honour the contract and demand restitution of any performance already made.

2 The one-year period commences on conclusion of the contract.

## [IV. Agreement to conclude a contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 22**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_22)

1 Parties may reach a binding agreement to enter into a contract at a later date.

2 Where in the interests of the parties the law makes the validity of a contract conditional on observance of a particular form, the same applies to the agreement to conclude a contract.

## [F. Defect in consent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F)

## [I. Error](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I)

## [1. Effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 23**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_23)

A party labouring under a fundamental error when entering into a contract is not bound by that contract.

## [2. Cases of mistake](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 24**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_24)

1 An error is fundamental in the following cases in particular:

  
1. where the party acting in error intended to conclude a contract different from that to which he consented;  
2. where the party acting in error has concluded a contract relating to a subject matter other than the subject matter he intended or, where the contract relates to a specific person, to a person other than the one he intended;  
3. where the party acting in error has promised to make a significantly greater performance or has accepted a promise of a significantly lesser consideration than he actually intended;  
4. where the error relates to specific facts which the party acting in error considered in good faith to be a necessary basis for the contract.

2 However, where the error relates solely to the reason for concluding the contract, it is not fundamental.

3 Calculation errors do not render a contract any less binding, but must be corrected.

## [3. Invoking error contrary to good faith](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 25**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_25)

1 A person may not invoke error in a manner contrary to good faith.

2 In particular, the party acting in error remains bound by the contract he intended to conclude, provided the other party accepts that contract.

## [4. Error by negligence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 26**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_26)

1 A party acting in error and invoking that error to repudiate a contract is liable for any damage arising from the nullity of the agreement where the error is attributable to his own negligence, unless the other party knew or should have known of the error.

2 In the interests of equity, the court may award further damages to the person suffering damage.

## [5. Incorrect intermediation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 27**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_27)

Where an offer to enter into a contract or the acceptance of that offer has been incorrectly communicated by a messenger or other intermediary, the provisions governing error apply *mutatis mutandis*.

## [II. Fraud](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 28**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_28)

1 A party induced to enter into a contract by the fraud of the other party is not bound by it even if his error is not fundamental.

2 A party who is the victim of fraud by a third party remains bound by the contract unless the other party knew or should have known of the fraud at the time the contract was concluded.

## [III. Duress](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_II_I)

## [1. Consent to contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_II_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 29**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_29)

1 Where a party has entered into a contract under duress from the other party or a third party, he is not bound by that contract.

2 Where the duress originates from a third party and the other party neither knew nor should have known of it, a party under duress who wishes to be released from the contract must pay compensation to the other party where equity so requires.

## [2. Definition of duress](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 30**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_30)

1 A party is under duress if, in the circumstances, he has good cause to believe that there is imminent and substantial risk to his own life, limb, reputation or property or to those of a person close to him.

2 The fear that another person might enforce a legitimate claim is taken into consideration only where the straitened circumstances of the party under duress have been exploited in order to extort excessive benefits from him.

## [IV. Defect of consent negated by ratification of the contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 31**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_31)

1 Where the party acting under error, fraud or duress neither declares to the other party that he intends not to honour the contract nor seeks restitution for the performance made within one year, the contract is deemed to have been ratified. 

2 The one-year period runs from the time that the error or the fraud was discovered or from the time that the duress ended.

3 The ratification of a contract made voidable by duress or fraud does not automatically exclude the right to claim damages.

## [G. Agency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G)

## [I. With authorisation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I)

## [1. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_1)

## [a. Effect of agency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_1/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 32**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_32)

1 The rights and obligations arising from a contract made by an agent in the name of another person accrue to the person represented, and not to the agent.

2 Where the agent did not make himself known as such when making the contract, the rights and obligations arising therefrom accrue directly to the person represented only if the other party must have inferred the agency relationship from the circumstances or did not care with whom the contract was made.

3 Where this is not the case, the claim must be assigned or the debt assumed in accordance with the principles governing such measures.

## [b. Scope of authority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_1/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 33**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_33)

1 Where authority to act on behalf of another stems from relationships established under public law, it is governed by the public law provisions of the Confederation or the cantons.

2 Where such authority is conferred by means of the transaction itself, its scope is determined by that transaction.

3 Where a principal grants such authority to a third party and informs the latter thereof, the scope of the authority conferred on the third party is determined according to wording of the communication made to him.

## [2. Authority arising from a transaction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_2)

## [a. Restriction and revocation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_2/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 34**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_34)

1 A principal authorising another to act on his behalf by means of a transaction may restrict or revoke such authority at any time without prejudice to any rights acquired by those involved under existing legal relationships, such as an individual contract of employment, a partnership agreement or an agency agreement. 

2 Any advance waiver of this right by the principal is void.

3 Where the represented party has expressly or de facto announced the authority he has conferred, he may not invoke its total or partial revocation against a third party acting in good faith unless he has likewise announced such revocation.

## [b. Effect of death, incapacity, etc.](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_1/chap_1/lvl_G/lvl_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 35**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_35)

1 The authority conferred by means of a transaction is extinguished on the loss of capacity to act, bankruptcy, death, or declaration of presumed death of the principal or the agent, unless the contrary has been agreed or is implied by the nature of the transaction.

###### [**Art. 70**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_70)

1 Where indivisible performance is due to several obligees, the obligor must make performance to all of them jointly, and each obligee may demand that performance be made to all of them jointly.

2 Where indivisible performance is due by several obligors, each of them has an obligation to make performance in full.

3 Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, an obligor who has satisfied the obligee may then claim proportionate compensation from the other obligors and to that extent the claim of the satisfied obligee passes to him.

## [3. Debt of generic object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 71**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_71)

1 If the object owed is defined only in generic terms, the obligor may choose what object is given in repayment unless otherwise stipulated under the legal relationship.

2 However, the obligor must not offer an object of less-than-average quality.

## [4. Obligations involving choice of performance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 74**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_74)

1 The place of performance is determined by the intention of the parties as stated expressly or evident from the circumstances.

2 Except where otherwise stipulated, the following principles apply:

  
1. pecuniary debts must be paid at the place where the creditor is resident at the time of performance;  
2. where a specific object is owed, it must be delivered at the place where it was located when the contract was entered into;  
3. other obligations must be discharged at the place where the obligor was resident at the time they arose.

3 Where the obligee may require performance of an obligation at his domicile but this has changed since the obligation arose, thereby significantly hindering performance by the obligor, the latter is entitled to render performance at the original domicile.

## [C. Time of performance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C)

## [I. Open-ended obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 75**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_75)

Where no time of performance is stated in the contract or evident from the nature of the legal relationship, the obligation may be discharged or called in immediately.

1 A time limit expressed as the beginning or end of a month means the first or last day of the month respectively. 

2 A time limit expressed as the middle of the month means the fifteenth day of that month.

## [2. Other time limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 77**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_77)

1 Where an obligation must be discharged or some other transaction accomplished within a certain time limit subsequent to conclusion of the contract, the time limit is defined as follows:

  
1. where the time limit is expressed as a number of days, performance falls due on the last thereof, not including the date on which the contract was concluded, and where the number stipulated is eight or fifteen days, this means not one or two weeks but a full eight or fifteen days;  
2. where the time limit is expressed as a number of weeks, performance falls due in the last week of the period on the same day of the week as the one on which the contract was concluded;  
3. where the time limit is expressed as a number of months or as a period comprising several months (a year, half-year or quarter), performance falls due in the last month of the period on the same day of the month as the one on which the contract was concluded or, where the last month of the period contains no such day, on the last day of that month.

The term ‘half-month’ has the same meaning as a time limit of fifteen days; if the time limit is expressed as a period of one or more months plus one half-month, the fifteen days are counted last.

2 Time limits are calculated in the same manner when stipulated as running from a date other than the date on which the contract was concluded.

3 Where an obligation must be discharged before a specified time limit, performance must occur before that time expires.

## [3. Sundays and public holidays](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 78**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_78)

1 Where the time of performance or the last day of a time limit falls on a Sunday or on a day officially recognised as a public holiday at the place of performance, the time of performance or the last day of a time limit is deemed to be the next working day.

2 Any agreement to the contrary is unaffected.

## [III. Performance during business hours](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 79**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_79)

Performance of the obligation must be made and accepted during normal business hours on the date stipulated.

## [IV. Extension of the time limit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 80**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_80)

Where the agreed time limit for performance is extended, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the new time limit runs from the first day following expiry of the previous time limit.

## [V. Early performance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_V)

###### [**Art. 81**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_81)

1 Unless the terms or nature of the contract or the circumstances indicate that the parties intended otherwise, performance may be rendered before the date on which the time limit expires.

2 However, the obligor is not entitled to apply a discount unless that discount has been agreed or is sanctioned by custom.

## [VI. In bilateral contracts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_V_I)

###### [**Art. 82**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_82)

A party to a bilateral contract may not demand performance until he has discharged or offered to discharge his own obligation, unless the terms or nature of the contract allow him to do so at a later date.

## [2. Allowance for unilateral insolvency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_V_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 83**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_83)

1 Where one party to a bilateral contract has become insolvent, in particular by virtue of bankruptcy proceedings or execution without satisfaction, and this deterioration in its financial position jeopardises the claim of the other party, the latter may withhold performance until security has been provided for the consideration.

2 He may withdraw from the contract if, on request, no such security is provided within a reasonable time.

## [D. Payment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_D)

1 Pecuniary debts must be discharged in legal tender of the currency in which the debt was incurred.

2A debt expressed in a currency other than the national currency of the place of payment may be discharged in that national currency at the rate of exchange that applies on the day it falls due, unless literal performance is required by inclusion in the contract of the expression ‘actual currency’ or words to that effect.

2 Where a creditor has received guarantees, pledges or other security for a portion of his claim, the debtor may not offset a part payment against that portion in preference to less well secured portions of the claim.

## [2. In the case of multiple debts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

1 A debtor with several debts to the same creditor is entitled to state at the time of payment which debt he means to redeem.

2 In the absence of any statement from the debtor, the payment will be allocated to the debt indicated by the creditor in his receipt, unless the debtor objects immediately.

## [b. By law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 87**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_87)

1 Where no valid debt redemption statement has been made and the receipt does not indicate how the payment has been allocated, it is allocated to whichever debt is due or, if several are due, to the debt that first gave rise to enforcement proceedings against the debtor or, in the absence of such proceedings, to the debt that fell due first.

2 Where several debts fell due at the same time, the payment is offset against them proportionately.

3 If none of the debts is yet due, the payment is allocated to the one offering the least security for the creditor.

## [III. Receipt and return of borrower’s note](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_II_I)

1 Where interest or other periodic payments are due, a creditor unreservedly issuing a receipt for a later periodic payment is presumed to have received all previous periodic payments.

2 If he issues a receipt for redemption of the debt principal, he is presumed to have received the interest.

3 The return of the borrower’s note to the debtor gives rise to a presumption that the debt has been redeemed.

## [3. Return of borrower’s note not possible](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

1 If the creditor claims to have lost the borrower’s note, on redeeming the debt, the debtor may insist that the creditor declare by public deed or notarised document that the borrower’s note has been annulled and the debt redeemed.

2 The provisions governing annulment of securities are reserved.

## [E. Default of obligee](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_E)

###### [**Art. 91**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_91)

The obligee is in default if he refuses without good cause to accept performance properly offered to him or to carry out such preparations as he is obliged to make and without which the obligor cannot render performance.

###### [**Art. 92**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_92)

1 Where the obligee is in default, the obligor is entitled to deposit the object at the expense and risk of the obligee, thereby discharging his obligation.

2The court decides which place should serve as depositary; however, merchandise may be deposited in a warehouse without need for a court decision.

## [b. Right to sell](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 93**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_93)

1 Where the characteristics of the object or the nature of the business preclude a deposit or the object is perishable or gives rise to maintenance costs or substantial storage costs, after having given formal warning to the obligee and with the court’s permission, the obligor may dispose of the object by open sale and deposit the sale proceeds.

2 Where the object has a quoted stock exchange or market price or its value is low in proportion to the costs involved, the sale need not be open and the court may authorise it without prior warning.

## [c. Right to take back the object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_1/lvl_E/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_c)

The obligor is entitled to deposit his performance or to withdraw from the contract, as in the case of default on the part of the obligee, where performance cannot be rendered either to the obligee or to his representative for some other reason pertaining to the obligee or where through no fault of the obligor there is uncertainty as to the identity of the obligee.

### [Section Two: The Consequences of Non-Performance of Obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2)

## [I. Obligor’s duty to compensate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I)

## [1. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 97**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_97)

1 An obligor who fails to discharge an obligation at all or as required must make amends for the resulting damage unless he can prove that he was not at fault.

2 The procedure for debt enforcement is governed by the provisions of the Federal Act of 11 April 1889 on Debt Collection and Bankruptcy and the Civil Procedure Code of 19 December 2008 (CPC).

## [2. Obligation to act or refrain from action](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 98**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_98)

1 Where the obligation is to take certain action, the obligee may without prejudice to his claims for damages obtain authority to perform the obligation at the obligor’s expense.

2 Where the obligation is to refrain from taking certain action, any breach of such obligation renders the obligor liable to make amends for the damage caused.

3 In addition, the obligee may request that the situation constituting a breach of the obligation be rectified and may obtain authority to rectify it at the obligor’s expense.

## [II. Scope of liability and compensation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 99**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_99)

1 The obligor is generally liable for any fault attributable to him.

2 The scope of such liability is determined by the particular nature of the transaction and in particular is judged more leniently where the obligor does not stand to gain from the transaction.

3 In other respects, the provisions governing liability in tort apply *mutatis mutandis* to a breach of contract.

## [2. Exclusion of liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 100**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_100)

1 Any agreement purporting to exclude liability for unlawful intent or gross negligence in advance is void.

2 At the discretion of the court, an advance exclusion of liability for minor negligence may be deemed void provided the party excluding liability was in the other party’s service at the time the waiver was made or the liability arises in connection with commercial activities conducted under official licence.

3 The specific provisions governing insurance policies are unaffected.

## [3. Liability for associates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 101**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_101)

1 A person who delegates the performance of an obligation or the exercise of a right arising from a contractual obligation to an associate, such as a member of his household or an employee is liable to the other party for any damage the associate causes in carrying out such tasks, even if their delegation was entirely authorised.

2 This liability may be limited or excluded by prior agreement.

3 If the obligee is in the obligor’s service or if the liability arises in connection with commercial activities conducted under official licence, any exclusion of liability by agreement may apply at most to minor negligence.

## [B. Default of obligor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B)

###### [**Art. 102**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_102)

1 Where an obligation is due, the obligor is in default as soon as he receives a formal reminder from the obligee.

2 Where a deadline for performance of the obligation has been set by agreement or as a result of a duly exercised right of termination reserved by one party, the obligor is automatically in default on expiry of the deadline.

## [II. Effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 103**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_103)

1 An obligor in default is liable in damages for late performance and even for accidental damage.

2 He may discharge himself from such liability by proving that his default occurred through no fault of his own or that the object of performance would have suffered the accidental damage to the detriment of the obligee even if performance had taken place promptly.

## [2. Default interest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

## [a. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 104**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_104)

1 A debtor in default on payment of a pecuniary debt must pay default interest of 5% per annum even where a lower rate of interest was stipulated by contract.

2 Where the contract envisages a rate of interest higher than 5%, whether directly or by agreement of a periodic bank commission, such higher rate of interest may also be applied while the debtor remains in default.

3 In business dealings, where the normal bank discount rate at the place of payment is higher than 5%, default interest may be calculated at the higher rate.

## [b. Debtor in default on payments of interest, annuities and gifts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 105**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_105)

1 A debtor in default on payment of interest, annuities or gifts is liable for default interest only as of the day on which enforcement proceedings are initiated or legal action is brought.

2 Any agreement to the contrary is assessed by the court in accordance with the provisions governing penalty clauses.

3 Default interest is never payable on default interest.

## [3. Excess damage](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 106**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_106)

1 Where the value of the damage suffered by the creditor exceeds the default interest, the debtor is liable also for this additional damage unless he can prove that he is not at fault.

2 Where the additional damage can be anticipated, the court may award compensation for such damage in its judgment on the main claim.

## [4. Withdrawal and damages](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 107**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_107)

1 Where the obligor under a bilateral contract is in default, the obligee is entitled to set an appropriate time limit for subsequent performance or to ask the court to set such time limit.

2 If performance has not been rendered by the end of that time limit, the obligee may compel performance in addition to suing for damages in connection with the delay or, provided he makes an immediate declaration to this effect, he may instead forego subsequent performance and either claim damages for non-performance or withdraw from the contract altogether.

## [b. Without time limit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 108**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_108)

No time limit need be set:

  
1. where it is evident from the conduct of the obligor that a time limit would serve no purpose;  
2. where performance has become pointless to the obligee as a result of the obligor’s default;  
3. where the contract makes it clear that the parties intended that performance take place at or before a precise point in time.

## [c. Effect of withdrawal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_c)

1 An obligee withdrawing from a contract may refuse the promised consideration and demand the return of any performance already made.

2 In addition he may claim damages for the lapse of the contract, unless the obligor can prove that he was not at fault.

###### [**Art. 110**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_110)

A third party who satisfies the creditor is by operation of law subrogated to his rights:

  
1. if he redeems an object given in pledge for the debt of another and he owns said object or has a limited right in rem in it;  
2. if the debtor notifies the creditor that the third party who is paying is to take the creditor’s place.

## [B. Guarantee of performance by third party](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_3/lvl_B)

## [I. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_3/lvl_C/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 112**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_112)

1 A person who, acting in his own name, has entered into a contract whereby performance is due to a third party is entitled to compel performance for the benefit of said third party.

2 The third party or his legal successors have the right to compel performance where that was the intention of the contracting parties or is the customary practice.

3 In this case the obligee may no longer release the obligor from his obligations once the third party has notified the obligor of his intention to exercise that right.

## [II. In the case of liability insurance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_2/chap_3/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 113**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_113)

###### [**Art. 114**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_114)

1 Where a claim ceases to exist by virtue of being satisfied or in some other manner, all accessory rights such as guarantees and charges are likewise extinguished.

2 Interest that has accrued may be reclaimed only if that right is conferred on the obligee by the contract or is evident from the circumstances.

3 The specific provisions governing charges on immovable property, securities and composition agreements are unaffected.

## [B. Extinction by agreement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_B)

###### [**Art. 115**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_115)

###### [**Art. 116**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_116)

1 Where a new debt relationship is contracted, there is no presumption of novation in respect of an old one.

2 In particular, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, novation does not result from signature of a bill of exchange in respect of an existing debt or from the issue of a new borrower’s note or contract of surety.

## [II. In relation to current accounts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 117**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_117)

1 The mere posting of individual entries in a current account does not result in novation.

2 However, there is a presumption of novation if the balance on the account has been drawn and acknowledged.

3 Where special security exists for one of the account entries, unless otherwise agreed, such security is retained even if the balance on the account is drawn and acknowledged.

## [D. Merger](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_D)

2 In the event of de-merger, the obligation is revived.

3 The specific provisions governing charges on immovable property and securities are unaffected.

###### [**Art. 119**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_119)

1 An obligation is deemed extinguished where its performance is made impossible by circumstances not attributable to the obligor.

2 In a bilateral contract, the obligor thus released is liable for the consideration already received pursuant to the provisions on unjust enrichment and loses his counter-claim to the extent it has not yet been satisfied.

3 This does not apply to cases in which, by law or contractual agreement, the risk passes to the obligee prior to performance.

## [F. Set-off](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_F)

3 A time-barred claim may be set off provided that it was not time-barred at the time it became eligible for set-off.

## [2. Under surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 122**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_122)

A person who has undertaken an obligation in favour of a third party may not set off that obligation against his own claims against said party.

## [4. Where the debtor is bankrupt](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_F/lvl_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 123**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_123)

1 Where the debtor is bankrupt, his creditors may set off their claims, even if they are not due, against the claims that the adjudicated bankrupt holds against them.

2 The exclusion or challenge of set-off in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy is governed by the provisions of debt collection and bankruptcy law.

## [II. Effect of set‑off](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_3/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 124**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_124)

1 A set-off takes place only if the debtor notifies the creditor of his intention to exercise his right of set-off.

2 Once this has occurred, to the extent that they cancel each other out, the claim and countervailing claim are deemed to have been satisfied as of the time they first became susceptible to set-off.

3 The special customs relating to commercial current accounts are unaffected.

2 Where the prescriptive period for the principal debtor is interrupted, it is likewise interrupted for the surety, provided the interruption is due to an act by the creditor.

3 However, where the prescriptive period for the guarantor is interrupted, it is not interrupted for the principal debtor.

4 An interruption effective against an insurer is also effective against the debtor and vice-versa, provided there is a direct claim against the insurer.

1bis The waiver must be made in writing. Only the user of general terms and conditions of business may waive the defence of prescription in such terms and conditions.

4 A waiver granted by a debtor shall bind the debtor’s insurers and vice-versa, provided a direct claim exists against the insurer.

2 The debtor may not compel performance of the obligation by the party assuming the debt until the debtor has discharged his obligations under the debt assumption contract.

3 If the previous debtor is not released from his debt, he may request that the new debtor furnish security.

## [II. Contract between debt acquirer and creditor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 176**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_176)

1 The accession of the debt acquirer to the debt relationship in lieu of and with the release of the previous debtor is effected by means of a contract between the debt acquirer and the creditor.

2 An offer to enter into the contract may consist of notification of the creditor that the debt is to be assumed. Notification must be made either by the debt acquirer or, on his authority, by the previous debtor.

3 The creditor’s acceptance may be express or implied by the circumstances and is presumed once the creditor unreservedly takes receipt of a payment from the debt acquirer or consents to some other act performed by him in the capacity of debtor.

## [2. Lapse of offer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 177**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_177)

1 The creditor may declare his acceptance at any time, but the debt acquirer and the former debtor may set the creditor a time limit for acceptance and where this expires without communication from the creditor, he is deemed to have refused the offer.

2 If the creditor agrees some other debt assumption arrangement before the offer has been accepted and the new prospective debt acquirer has also made an offer to the creditor, the party that made the previous offer is no longer bound thereby.

## [III. Effect of change of debtor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 178**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_178)

1 The rights that are accessory to the debt remain unaffected by the change of debtor save to the extent that they are inseparable from the person of the previous debtor.

2 However, pledges and sureties provided by third parties remain in place in favour of the creditor only provided the pledgor or surety has consented to the assumption of the debt.

## [2. Objections](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 179**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_179)

1 Any defences arising from the debt relationship are available to the new debtor as they were to the former.

2 The new debtor may not invoke the defences personally available to the old debtor against the creditor, unless otherwise provided in the contract with the creditor.

3 Where the debt acquirer has defences arising against the debtor from the legal relationship underlying the assumption of debt, these may not be invoked against the creditor.

## [IV. Failure of debt assumption contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 180**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_180)

1 In the event of the failure of the debt assumption contract, the previous debtor’s obligation is revived with all accessory rights, subject to the rights of bona fide third parties.

2 The creditor may also claim damages from the would-be debt acquirer for any damage suffered as a result of the loss of security previously obtained or for similar reasons, unless the would-be debt acquirer can prove that he was in no way to blame for the failure of the debt assumption contract or the damage caused to the creditor.

## [V. Assignment of assets or a business with assets and liabilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_V)

###### [**Art. 181**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_181)

1 A person to whom assets or a business with assets and liabilities are assigned automatically becomes liable to the creditors of the debts encumbering such assets or business on notification of the assignment to the creditors by him or by publication in official journals.

2 However, the previous debtor remains jointly and severally liable with the new debtor for three years, commencing on the date of notification or publication in the case of claims already due and on the maturity date in the case of claims falling due subsequently.

3 In other respects, an assumption of debt of this kind has the same effect as the assumption of an individual debt.

4 The takeover by assignment of assets or businesses of commercial enterprises, cooperatives, associations, foundations or sole proprietorships registered in the commercial register is governed by the provisions of the Mergers Act of 3 October 2003.

## [VI. ...](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_1/tit_5/lvl_B/lvl_V_I)

1 The benefit and risk of the object pass to the buyer on conclusion of the contract, except where otherwise agreed or dictated by special circumstance.

2 Where the object sold is defined only in generic terms, the seller must select the particular item to be delivered and, if it is to be shipped, must hand it over for dispatch.

3 In a contract subject to a condition precedent, benefit and risk of the object do not pass to the buyer until the condition has been fulfilled.

1 Any sale in which the object is not land, property or a right in rem entered in the land register is a chattel sale.

2 Where constituent parts of land, such as crops, architectural salvage materials or quarry products, are separated therefrom for transfer to the acquirer, their sale constitutes a chattel sale.

2 The seller is presumed to have borne the transport costs where free delivery has been agreed.

## [b. Surrender of object without court decision](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 194**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_194)

1. restitution of the price paid, with interest, less the value of any fruits the buyer has obtained or neglected to obtain from the object and other benefits derived therefrom;  
2. reimbursement of his expenditures on the object, to the extent this cannot be obtained from the third party with the superior right;  
3. reimbursement of all judicial and extra-judicial costs arising from the proceedings, apart from those he would have avoided by serving third-party notice on the seller;  
4. compensation for all other damage directly caused by the dispossession.

2 The seller is also obliged to make good any further loss suffered by the buyer unless the seller can prove that he is not at fault.

## [b. Partial dispossession](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3/lvl_b)

2 However, where in the circumstances there is cause to presume that he would not have entered into the contract if he had foreseen such a partial dispossession, he has the right to request its termination.

3 In this case, he must return to the seller that part of the item of which he has not been dispossessed together with the benefits he obtained from it in the interim.

## [c. Objects of cultural heritage](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3/lvl_c)

3 Where such defects come to light subsequently, the seller must be notified immediately, failing which the object will be deemed accepted even in respect of such defects.

## [b. In livestock trading](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_4/lvl_b)

2 The buyer is obliged to have the condition of the object duly and promptly witnessed, failing which he will bear the burden of proving that the alleged defects already existed when he took receipt of the object.

3 Where there is a risk that the object will rapidly deteriorate, the buyer has the right and, should the interests of the seller so require, the obligation to arrange its sale with the assistance of the competent authority of the place where the object is located, but must notify the seller of such sale as soon as possible to avoid rendering himself liable in damages.

2 Even where the buyer has brought action for rescission the court is free to order a reduction in the price of the object if it does not consider rescission justified by the circumstances.

3 If the decrease in the object’s value is equal to the sale price, the buyer may only sue for rescission.

## [b. Substitute performance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_7/lvl_b)

1 Action for rescission of the contract of sale may be brought if the object has been destroyed as a result of its defects or by accident.

2 In such cases the buyer must return only that which remains of the object.

3 If the object is destroyed through the fault of the buyer or has been sold on or transformed by him, his only claim is for compensation for the decrease in value.

## [8. Rescission of the contract of sale](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_8)

## [a. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_8/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 208**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_208)

1 In the event of rescission of the contract of sale the buyer must return the object to the seller together with any benefits derived from it in the interim.

2 The seller must reimburse to the buyer the sale price paid together with interest and, in accordance with the provisions governing full dispossession, compensation for litigation costs, expenses and the damage incurred by the buyer as a result of the delivery of defective goods.

3 The seller is obliged to compensate the buyer for any further damage unless he can prove that no fault is attributable to him.

## [b. For sales of batches or sets of objects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_8/lvl_b)

1 Where the sale involves a batch or set of objects of which only some are defective, action for rescission may be brought only in respect of the defective items.

2 However, where the defective items cannot be separated from the unflawed items without substantial prejudice to the buyer or the seller, rescission of the contract of sale must extend to the entire batch or set.

3 Rescission in respect of the main sale object necessarily involves rescission in respect of all accessory objects even if they are priced separately, whereas rescission in respect of accessory objects does not extend to the main object.

## [9. Prescription](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_9)

###### [**Art. 210**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_210)

1 An action for breach of warranty of quality and fitness prescribes two years after delivery of the object to the buyer, even if he does not discover the defects until later, unless the seller has assumed liability under warranty for a longer period.

2 The period amounts to five years where defects in an object that has been incorporated in an immovable work in a manner consistent with its nature and purpose have caused the work to be defective.

3 In the case of cultural property within the meaning of Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Cultural Property Transfer Act of 20 June 2003, actions for breach of warranty of quality and fitness prescribe one year after the buyer discovered the defect but in any event 30 years after the contract was concluded.

4 An agreement to reduce the prescriptive period is null and void if:

  
a. the prescriptive period is reduced to less than two years, or less than one year in the case of second-hand goods;  
b. the object is intended to be used by the buyer or his or her family; and  
c. the seller is acting in the course of his or her professional or commercial activities.

5 The defence of defective goods remains available to the buyer provided he has notified the seller within the prescriptive period.

6 The seller may not invoke the prescriptive period if it is proved that he wilfully misled the buyer. The foregoing does not apply to the 30-year period under paragraph 3.

2 Unless otherwise provided by agreement or custom, such acceptance must take place immediately.

###### [**Art. 212**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_212)

1 Where the buyer places a firm order without indicating the sale price, the price is presumed to be the average current market price at the place of performance.

2 Where the price is based on the weight of the goods, the weight of the packaging (tare) is deducted.

3 The foregoing does not apply to special commercial customs whereby the gross weight of certain resale merchandise is reduced by a set amount or percentage or the price is based on the gross weight including packaging.

## [III. Time when price falls due, interest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_C/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 213**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_213)

1 The price falls due as soon as the property passes into the buyer’s possession, unless some other juncture is agreed.

2 Regardless of the provision governing default on expiry of a specified time limit, interest accrues on the sale price even if no reminder is issued where such practice is customary or the buyer may derive fruits or other benefits from the purchased object.

## [IV. Buyer in default](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_C/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 214**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_214)

1 Where the property is to be delivered against advance payment of the price in full or in instalments and the buyer is in default on such payment, the seller is entitled to withdraw from the contract without further formality.

2 However, if he intends to exercise this right he must notify the buyer immediately.

3 Where the purchased object has passed into the buyer’s possession prior to payment, the seller may withdraw from the contract on the grounds that the buyer is in default and demand the return of the object only if he has expressly reserved the right to do so.

## [2. Liability for and computation of damages](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_2/lvl_C/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

1 Where the buyer in a commercial transaction fails to discharge his payment obligation, the seller is entitled to compensation for the difference between the sale price and the price at which he has subsequently sold the object in good faith.

2 In the case of goods with a market or stock exchange price, the seller is entitled to claim as damages the difference between the contractual sale price and the market price at the time of performance without needing to sell the object on.

2 In any event the other party is entitled to prove that the sample is not the same one.

3 If the sample has been spoiled or been destroyed while in the possession of the buyer, even if he was not at fault, the onus is not on the seller to prove that the object conforms with the sample, but on the buyer to prove the contrary.

## [III. Inspection on the buyer’s premises](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_6/chap_4/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

2 However, the new owner may:

  
a. serve notice to terminate a lease on residential or commercial premises as of the next legally admissible termination date if he claims an urgent need of such premises for himself, his close relatives or in-laws;  
b. serve notice to terminate a rental agreement in respect of other objects as of the next legally admissible termination date unless the contract allows for earlier termination.

3 If the new owner terminates sooner than is permitted under the contract with the existing landlord or lessor, the latter is liable for all resultant losses.

1 The tenant of commercial premises may transfer his lease to a third party with the landlord’s written consent.

2 The landlord may withhold consent only for good cause.

3 Once the landlord gives his consent, the third party is subrogated to the rights and obligations of the tenant under the lease.

4 The tenant is released from his obligations towards the landlord. However, he remains jointly and severally liable with the third party until such time as the lease ends or may be terminated under the contract or by law, but in any event for no more than two years.

## [M. Early return of the object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_8/chap_1/lvl_M)

2 Otherwise, the tenant or lessee must continue to pay the rent until such time as the lease ends or may be terminated under the contract or by law.

3 Against the rent owing to him, the landlord or lessor must permit account to be taken of:

  
a. any expenses he has saved, and  
b. any earnings which he has obtained, or intentionally failed to obtain, from putting the object to some other use.

b. they are justified by increases in costs or by additional services provided by the landlord;  
c. in the case of a recently constructed property, they do not exceed the range of gross pre-tax yield required to cover costs;

1 By means of an individual employment contract, the employee undertakes to work in the service of the employer for a limited or unlimited period and the employer undertakes to pay him a salary based on the amount of time he works (time wage) or the tasks he performs (piece work).

2 A contract whereby an employee undertakes to work regularly in the employer’s service by hours, half-days or days (part-time work) is likewise deemed to be an individual employment contract.

1 Except where the law provides otherwise, the individual employment contract is not subject to any specific formal requirement.

2 It is deemed to have been concluded where the employer accepts the performance of work over a certain period in his service which in the circumstances could reasonably be expected only in exchange for salary.

3 Where an employee performs work in good faith for the employer under a contract which is subsequently found to be invalid, both parties must discharge their obligations under the employment relationship as if the contract had been valid until such time as one party terminates the relationship on grounds of the invalidity of the contract.

3 For the duration of the employment relationship the employee must not perform any paid work for third parties in breach of his duty of loyalty, in particular if such work is in competition with his employer.

4 For the duration of the employment relationship the employee must not exploit or reveal confidential information obtained while in the employer’s service, such as manufacturing or trade secrets; he remains bound by such duty of confidentiality even after the end of the employment relationship to the extent required to safeguard the employer’s legitimate interests.

## [III. Disclosure and hand-over of benefits received and work produced](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

1 If more hours of work are required than envisaged under the employment contract or provided for by custom, standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employee is obliged to perform such overtime to the extent that he is able and may conscionably be expected to do so. 

2 In consultation with the employee, the employer may compensate him within an appropriate period for the overtime worked by granting him time off in lieu of at least equal length. 

3 Where the overtime is not compensated by time off in lieu and unless otherwise agreed in writing or under a standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employer must compensate the employee for the overtime worked by paying him his normal salary and a supplement of at least one-quarter thereof.

1 The employee is liable for any damage he causes to the employer whether wilfully or by negligence.

2 The extent of the duty of care owed by the employee is determined by the individual employment contract, taking due account of the occupational risk, level of training and technical knowledge associated with the work as well as the employee’s aptitudes and skills of which the employer was or should have been aware.

2 The employer must furnish all the necessary information to the employee or, in his stead, to an expert designated by both employer and employee or appointed by the court and must grant the employee or the expert such access to the accounts as is required for verification of the business results. 

3 In addition, where a share in the profits of the business has been agreed, a copy of the profit and loss account must be made available to the employee on request.

2 In the case of transactions involving performance in instalments and insurance policies, it may be agreed in writing that such entitlement arises as each instalment falls due or is performed.

3 The entitlement to commission lapses subsequently if through no fault of his the employer fails to carry out the transaction or the third party fails to fulfil his obligations; in the event of only partial performance, the commission is reduced proportionately.

2 Subject to longer periods being fixed by individual agreement, standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employer must pay three weeks’ salary during the first year of service and thereafter the salary for appropriately longer periods depending on the duration of the employment relationship and the particular circumstances.

3 The employer has the same obligation in the event that an employee becomes pregnant.

4 A written agreement, standard employment contract or collective employment contract may derogate from the above provisions provided it gives the employee terms of at least equivalent benefit.

## [b. Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_II_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

2 Any assignment or pledge of future salary claims as security for other obligations is void.

3 If the rate of pay for such time work is not fixed by individual agreement, standard employment contract or collective employment contract, the employer must pay the employee the average salary he previously earned on a piece work basis.

4 An employer who is unable to allocate sufficient piece work or time work remains nonetheless obliged pursuant to the provisions governing failure to accept performance to pay the salary that he would have paid for time work.

## [2. Piece work rates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_V/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 331***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_331_d)

1 At any time up to three years before becoming entitled to draw retirement benefits, the employee may pledge his entitlement to occupational benefits or an amount up to the limit of his transferable benefits for the purpose of acquiring a property for his own personal use.

2 The pledge is also permitted for the purpose of acquiring shares in a housing cooperative or similar participatory venture provided a residential unit jointly financed in this manner is for the employee’s own personal use.

3 The pledge is valid only if notified in writing to the benefits scheme.

4 The amount pledged by employees aged 50 or older must not exceed the transferable benefit entitlement they would have had at 50 or one-half of their transferable benefit entitlement at the time the pledge is given.

5 Married employees may pledge benefits only with the written consent of their spouse. Where the employee cannot obtain such consent or if it is withheld, the employee may apply to the civil courts. The same applies to registered partnerships.

6 Where the pledge is realised before the benefits fall due or the cash payment is made, Articles 30*d*, 30*e*, 30*g* and Article 83*a* of the Federal Act of 25 June 1982 on Occupational Old Age, Survivors' and Invalidity Pension Provision are applicable. 

7 The Federal Council determines:

  
a. the purposes for which the pledge is permissible and the definition of ‘own personal use’;  
b. the conditions to be fulfilled for the pledging of entitlements to acquire shares in a housing cooperative or similar participatory venture.

## [2. Early withdrawal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_V/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 331***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_331_e)

1 At any time up to three years before becoming entitled to draw retirement benefits, the employee may claim an amount from his benefits scheme for the purpose of acquiring a property for his own personal use.

2 Employees under the age of 50 may withdraw an amount up to the limit of their transferable benefits. Employees aged 50 or older are entitled to withdraw no more than the transferable benefit entitlement they would have had at 50 or one-half of their transferable benefit entitlement at the time of the early withdrawal. 

3 The employee may also use such amount for the purpose of acquiring shares in a housing cooperative or similar participatory venture provided a residential unit jointly financed in this manner is for the employee’s own personal use.

4 The early withdrawal brings about an immediate reduction in occupational benefit entitlements in accordance with the benefits scheme regulations and the actuarial basis employed by the benefits scheme. In order to avoid a shortfall in benefits cover resulting from this reduction in benefits in the event of death or disability, the benefits scheme offers supplementary insurance either directly or as broker for a third-party insurer.

5 Married employees may make such an early withdrawal and any subsequent establishment of a charge on immovable property only with the written consent of their spouse. Where the employee cannot obtain such consent or if it is withheld, the employee may apply to the civil courts. The same applies to registered partnerships.

6 Where married persons divorce before the benefits fall due, the early withdrawal is deemed a transferable benefit and is divided in accordance with Article 123 of the Civil Code, Articles 280 and 281 CPO and Articles 22–22*b* of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993. The same applies in the event of judicial dissolution of a registered partnership.

7 If the early withdrawal or pledge of entitlements jeopardises the liquidity of the benefits scheme, the fund may defer execution of the requests concerned. The benefits scheme must lay down in its regulations the order of priority in which early withdrawals or pledges of entitlements will be deferred in such an event. The Federal Council regulates the details.

8 In other respects Articles 30*d*, 30*e*, 30*g* and Article 83*a* of the Federal Act of 25 June 1982 on Occupational Old Age, Survivors' and Invalidity Pension Provision are applicable. 

## [3. Restrictions if the benefits scheme has a cover deficit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_D/lvl_V/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 331***f*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_331_f)

1 The benefits scheme may provide in its regulations that the pledges of assignments, early withdrawals and repayments may be subject to time or volume restrictions or even refused while the fund has a cover deficit.

2 The Federal Council determines the conditions under which the restrictions stipulated in para. 1 are permissible and the scope thereof.

## [E. Right to inventions and designs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_E)

###### [**Art. 332**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_332)

1 Inventions and designs produced by the employee alone or in collaboration with others in the course of his work for the employer and in performance of his contractual obligations belong to the employer, whether or not they may be protected.

2 By written agreement, the employer may reserve the right to acquire inventions and designs produced by the employee in the course of his work for the employer but not in performance of his contractual obligations.

3 An employee who produces an invention or design covered by paragraph 2 must notify the employer thereof in writing; the employer must inform the employee within six months if he wishes to acquire the invention or design or release it to the employee.

4 Where it is not released to the employee, the employer must pay him separate, appropriate remuneration to be determined with due regard to all pertinent circumstances and in particular the economic value of the invention or design, the degree to which the employer contributed, any reliance on other staff and on the employer’s facilities, the expenses incurred by the employee and his position in the company.

1bis Where the transferred relationship is governed by a collective employment contract, the acquirer is obliged to abide by it for one year unless it expires or is terminated sooner. 

2 In the event that the employee refuses the transfer, the employment relationship ends on expiry of the statutory notice period; until then, the acquirer and the employee are obliged to perform the contract.

3 The former employer and the acquirer are jointly and severally liable for any claims of an employee which fell due prior to the transfer or which fall due between that juncture and the date on which the employment relationship could normally be terminated or is terminated following refusal of the transfer.

4 Moreover, the employer may not transfer the rights arising from an employment relationship to a third party unless otherwise agreed or dictated by the circumstances.

1 Where the employer transfers the company or a part thereof to a third party, he must inform the organisation that represents the employees or, where there is none, the employees themselves in good time before the transfer takes place of:

  
a. the reason for the transfer;  
b. its legal, economic and social consequences for the employees.

2 Where measures affecting the employees are envisaged as a result of such transfer, the organisation that represents the employees or, where there is none, the employees themselves must be consulted in good time before the relevant decisions are taken.

## [3. Transfer of the company on insolvency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_3)

#### [A. The Collective Employment Contract](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A)

## [I. Definition, content, form and duration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I)

## [1. Definition and content](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 356**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_356)

1 A collective employment contract is a contract whereby employers or employers’ associations and employees’ associations jointly lay down clauses governing the conclusion, nature and termination of employment relationships between the employers and individual employees.

2 The collective employment contract may also contain other clauses, provided they pertain to the relationship between employers and employees or are limited to the formulation of such clauses.

3 Further, the collective employment contract may define the mutual rights and obligations of the contracting parties and the monitoring and enforcement of the clauses specified in the previous paragraphs.

4 Where more than one employers’ association and/or employees’ association is bound by the collective employment contract either from the outset or as a result of subsequent accession with the consent of the original contracting parties, they have equal rights and obligations thereunder and any contrary agreement is void.

## [2. Freedom of association and freedom to practise a profession](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 356***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_356_a)

1 Any clause in a collective employment contract or individual agreement between the contracting parties intended to compel an employer or employee to join a contracting association is void.

2 Any clause in a collective employment contract or individual agreement between the contracting parties intended to exclude or restrict the practice of a particular profession or occupation by an employee or his acquisition of the necessary vocational training is void. 

3 The clauses and agreements referred to in the previous paragraph are valid by way of exception if they are justified by overriding interests that warrant protection, in particular personal health and safety or the quality of work; however, denial of access to the profession is not an interest that warrants protection.

## [3. Accession](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 356***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_356_b)

1 Individual employers and individual employees in the service of employers bound by the collective employment contract may accede to it with the consent of the contracting parties, whereupon they become participating employers and employees.

2 The collective employment contract may stipulate the rules governing such accession. Unreasonable conditions attaching to accession, such as unreasonable monetary contributions, may be declared void or limited to an admissible level by the court; however, clauses and agreements intended to set contributions in favour of one individual contracting party are always void.

3 Any clause in a collective employment contract or individual agreement between the contracting parties intended to compel members of associations to accede to the collective employment contract is void if such associations are not entitled to become party to it or to conclude an analogous contract.

## [4. Form and duration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 356***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_356_c)

1 The conclusion of a collective employment contract, its amendment and termination by mutual agreement, the accession of a new contracting party and notice to terminate the contract are valid only if done in writing, as are declarations of accession by individual employers or employees, the consent to such accession by the contracting parties pursuant to Article 356*b* paragraph 1 and notice to withdraw from the contract.

2 Where the collective employment contract is open-ended and does not provide otherwise, after one year has elapsed any of the contracting parties may withdraw from it at any time by giving six months’ notice, which is effective for all other parties. The same applies *mutatis mutandis* to parties subsequently acceding to the contract.

## [II. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 357**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_357)

1 Unless otherwise stipulated in the collective employment contract, its provisions relating to the formation, nature and termination of individual employment relationships are binding on the participating employers and employees for the duration of the contract and may not be derogated.

2 Any agreement between participating employers and employees that contradicts the compulsory provisions of the collective employment contract is void and replaced by those provisions; however, such an agreement may be valid if it is to the benefit of the employee.

## [2. On the contracting parties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 357***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_357_a)

1 The contracting parties are obliged to ensure compliance with the collective employment contract; to this end associations must exert their influence on their members and, where required, have recourse to the means placed at their disposal by their articles of association and the law.

2 Each contracting party has a duty to maintain harmonious industrial relations and in particular to refrain from any hostile action on matters regulated by the collective employment contract; such duty applies without restriction only where expressly so agreed.

## [3. Joint enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

1 A collective employment contract concluded between associations may stipulate that each contracting party has an actionable claim against the other parties in the event that they fail to discharge their duty to ensure that the participating employers and employees abide by the contract as regards the following matters: 

  
a. the formation, nature and termination of employment relationships, in respect of which the claim is for a declaratory judgment only;  
b. the payment of contributions to equalisation funds or other institutions in connection with the employment relationship, the representation of employees within businesses and the maintenance of harmonious industrial relations;  
c. monitoring activities, the provision of security and contractual penalties in relation to the provisions set out in letters a and b.

2 Clauses within the meaning of the previous paragraph may be agreed where the contracting parties are expressly authorised so to do by their articles of association or resolution passed by their governing body.

3 Unless otherwise stipulated in the collective employment contract, the provisions governing simple partnerships are applicable *mutatis mutandis* to relations between the contracting parties. 

## [III. Relationship to mandatory law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 358**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_358)

The mandatory law of the Confederation and the cantons takes precedence over the collective employment contract; however, other provisions may be agreed to the benefit of employees provided they do not conflict with mandatory law.

###### [**Art. 359***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_359_a)

1 Where the scope of application of a standard employment contract extends over more than one canton, the Federal Council is responsible for issuing it, but otherwise the canton is responsible.

2 Before being issued, the standard employment contract shall be published in an appropriate manner and a time limit set within which interested parties may submit their comments in writing; furthermore, the relevant professional associations and public bodies shall be consulted.

3 The standard employment contract comes into force once it has been issued in accordance with the provisions governing official publications.

4 The same procedure applies to the rescission or amendment of a standard employment contract.

## [III. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 360***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_360_a)

1 Where the wages that are customary for a geographical area, occupation or industry are repeatedly and unfairly undercut within a particular occupation or economic sector and there is no collective employment contract laying down a minimum wage that may be declared universally binding, on application by the tripartite commission as defined in Article 360*b,* the competent authority may issue a fixed-term standard employment contract providing for a minimum wage varied by region and, where applicable, by locality in order to combat or prevent abusive practices.

2 The minimum wage must not conflict with the public interest or prejudice the legitimate interests of other economic sectors or sections of the population. It must have due regard to the minority interests of the economic sectors or occupations concerned that stem from regional and business diversity.

3 In the case of repeated infringements of the provisions on the minimum wage in a standard employment contract in accordance with paragraph 1 or if there is evidence that no longer using the standard employment contract may lead to further abusive practices in terms of paragraph 1, at the request of the tripartite commission, the competent authority may extend the standard employment contract for a limited period.

## [2. Tripartite commissions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

2 Employers’ and employees’ associations have the right to put forward candidates for selection as their representatives within the meaning of paragraph 1.

3 The commissions monitor the labour market. If they observe abusive practices within the meaning of Article 360*a* paragraph 1, they normally seek to reach agreement directly with the employers concerned. Where this cannot be achieved within two months, they petition the competent authority to issue a standard employment contract fixing a minimum wage for the affected sectors or occupations.

4 If labour market conditions in the affected sectors change, the tripartite commission petitions the competent authority to amend or rescind the standard employment contract.

5 To enable them to discharge their responsibilities, the tripartite commissions have the right to obtain information and inspect any business document necessary to the conduct of their investigation. In the event of a dispute, a ruling is given by a body specially appointed for this purpose by the Confederation or the canton, as applicable.

6 Where necessary for the conduct of their investigations, on application the tripartite commissions may obtain personal data contained in corporate collective employment contracts from the Federal Statistical Office.

## [3. Official secrecy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_V/lvl_3)

2 It is not permissible to derogate from a standard employment contract as defined in Article 360*a* to the detriment of the employee.

## [5. Associations’ right of action](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_10/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_V/lvl_5)

## [b. Rights of the customer in the event of defects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_11/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_4/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 368**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_368)

1 Where the work is so defective or deviates from the contractual terms to such an extent that the customer has no use for it or cannot equitably be expected to accept it, the customer may refuse acceptance and, if the contractor is at fault, seek damages.

2 In the case of minor defects in the work or only slight deviations from the contractual terms, the customer may reduce the price in proportion to the decrease in its value or require the contractor to rectify the work at his own expense and to pay damages if he was at fault, provided such rectification is possible without excessive cost to the contractor.

3 In the case of work carried out on the customer’s land or property which by its nature cannot be removed without disproportionate detriment to the contractor, the customer has only the rights stipulated in paragraph 2.

## [c. Customer’s liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_11/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_4/lvl_c)

## [d. Approval of the work](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_11/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_4/lvl_d)

###### [**Art. 370**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_370)

1 Once the completed work has been expressly or tacitly approved by the customer, the contractor is released from all liability save in respect of defects which could not have been discovered on acceptance and normal inspection or were deliberately concealed by the contractor.

2 Tacit approval is presumed where the customer omits to inspect the work and give notice of defects as provided by law.

3 Where defects come to light only subsequently, the customer must notify the contractor as soon as he becomes aware of them, failing which the work is deemed to have been approved even in respect of such defects.

However, the prescriptive period amounts to five years where defects in a movable object that has been incorporated in an immovable work in a manner consistent with its nature and purpose have caused the work to be defective.

2 The customer’s claims in respect of defects in an immovable work against both the contractor and any architect or engineer who rendered services in connection with such work prescribe five years after completion of the work.

2 In this case any loss of materials is borne by the party that supplied them.

3 Where the work has been destroyed either due to a defect in the materials supplied or the construction site designated by the customer or as a result of the method of performance prescribed by him, the contractor is entitled to payment for the work already done and of expenses incurred that were not included in the price, provided he alerted the customer to the risks in good time, and also to damages if the customer was at fault.

1 Where no clause was agreed that stipulates the number of editions, the publisher is entitled to produce only one.

2 Where nothing was agreed, the publisher determines the size of the edition but at the originator’s request must print at least enough to generate reasonable sales, and once the first print run is completed he must not print any further copies.

3 Where the publishing contract confers publishing rights for several or all editions of a work and the publisher fails to produce a new edition after the previous edition is exhausted, the originator may have the court set a time limit for the publication of a new edition, failing which the publisher forfeits such rights.

3 In either case he is entitled to appropriate compensation.

The agent may not waive this right in advance.

Any agreement of a shorter notice period must be done in writing.

2 Where the contract has lasted for at least one year, it may be terminated by giving two months’ notice expiring at the end of a calendar quarter. However, the parties may agree a longer notice period or a different termination date.

3 The notice period must be the same for both the principal and the agent.

1 Where the agent’s activities have resulted in a substantial expansion of the principal’s clientele and considerable benefits accrue even after the end of the agency relationship to the principal or his legal successor from his business relations with clients acquired by the agent, the agent or his heirs have an inalienable claim for adequate compensation, provided this is not inequitable.

2 The amount of such claim must not exceed the agent’s net annual earnings from the agency relationship calculated as the average for the last five years or, where shorter, the average over the entire duration of the contract.

3 No claim exists where the agency relationship has been dissolved for a reason attributable to the agent.

1 The agent is liable for negligence.

2 However, where the agent acted in order to avert imminent damage to the principal, his liability is judged more leniently.

3 Where agency activities are carried out against the express or otherwise recognisable will of the principal and the prohibition was neither immoral nor illegal, the agent is also liable for chance occurrences unless he can prove that they would have occurred even without his involvement.

## [III. Liability of agents lacking capacity to enter into contracts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_14/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

1 Where agency activities were in the best interests of the principal, he is obliged to reimburse the agent for all expenses that were necessary or useful and appropriate in the circumstances plus interest, to release him to the same extent from all obligations assumed and to compensate him at the court’s discretion for any other damage incurred.

2 Provided the agent acted with all due care, the claim accrues to him even if the intended outcome was not achieved.

3 Where the agent’s expenses are not reimbursed, he has the right of repossession in accordance with the provisions governing unjust enrichment.

## [II. Business conducted in the agent’s interests](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_14/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

1 Where the goods for sale on commission are evidently defective, the commission agent must safeguard the rights of recourse against the carrier, secure evidence of the defective condition of the goods, preserve the goods where possible and notify the principal immediately.

2 If the commission agent omits to discharge these obligations, he is liable for any damage caused by such omission.

3 Where there is a risk that the goods for sale on commission will rapidly deteriorate, the commission agent has the right and, should the interests of the principal so require, the obligation to arrange their sale with the assistance of the competent authority of the place where the goods are located.

## [3. Pricing by the principal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

2 Furthermore, where the commission agent is at fault, he must compensate the principal for any other damage caused by the breach of contract.

3 Where the commission agent buys at a lower price or sells at a higher price than instructed by the principal, he is not permitted to retain the profit but must credit it to the principal.

1 A commission agent who makes cash advances or extends credit to a third party without the consent of the principal does so at his own risk.

2 However, where sale on credit is the customary commercial practice at the place of sale, the commission agent is entitled to sell on credit unless the principal has instructed otherwise.

## [5. Del credere](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_5)

1 The commission agent forfeits his right to commission if he has acted improperly towards the principal and in particular if he has secured an inflated purchase price or a deflated sale price.

2 Moreover, in both these cases the principal has the right to take action against the commission agent himself as buyer or seller.

## [3. Special lien](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

1 Where the goods on commission remain unsold or the order to sell is withdrawn and the principal fails to take them back or otherwise dispose of them within a reasonable time, the commission agent may apply to the competent authority at the place where the goods are located to arrange to have them sold at auction.

2 The auction may be ordered without first hearing the principal if neither he nor a representative is present at that location.

3 However, official notice must be served on the principal before the auction is held, unless the goods in question are susceptible to rapid deterioration.

## [5. Agent acting for his own account](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 436**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_436)

1 Unless otherwise instructed by the principal, a commission agent instructed to buy or sell goods, bills of exchange or other securities with a quoted exchange or market price is entitled, in his own capacity as seller, to deliver the goods he is instructed to buy or, in his own capacity as buyer, to purchase the goods he is instructed to sell.

2 In both cases, the commission agent must account for the exchange or market price that applied at the time the instruction was executed and is entitled to both the usual commission and reimbursement of the expenses normally incurred in commission business.

3 In other respects the transaction is treated as a contract of sale.

## [b. Presumption of trading for own account](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_5/lvl_b)

## [c. Lapse of right to trade for own account](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_15/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_5/lvl_c)

3. the carrier has sent the consignee written notice that the goods have arrived and are ready for collection;

###### [**Art. 447**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_447)

1 If the goods are lost or destroyed, the carrier must compensate their full value unless he can prove that the loss or destruction resulted from the nature of the goods or through the fault of the consignor or the consignee or occurred as a result of instructions given by either or of circumstances which could not have been prevented even by the diligence of a prudent carrier.

2 The consignor is deemed to be at fault if he fails to inform the carrier of any especially valuable freight goods.

3 Agreements stipulating an interest in excess of the full value of the goods or an amount of compensation lower than their full value are reserved.

## [b. Delay, damage, partial destruction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_16/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

1 Unconditional acceptance of the goods and payment of the freight charge extinguish all claims against the carrier, except in cases of deliberate deceit or gross negligence.

2 Furthermore, the carrier remains liable for damage that is not externally apparent where such damage is discovered within the time in which, in the circumstances, the consignee was able or might reasonably be expected to inspect the goods, provided he notifies the carrier immediately on discovering such damage.

3 However, such notification must be given no later than eight days after delivery.

## [6. Procedure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_16/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_6)

3The above does not apply to cases of malice or gross negligence on the part of the carrier.

2 Such expenses must be reimbursed immediately, whereas the warehouse fee is payable in arrears for every three months of storage and in any event whenever all or some of the goods are reclaimed.

3 The warehouse keeper’s claims are secured by a lien on the goods, provided he remains in possession of the goods or may dispose of them by means of a document of title to goods.

1 The warehouse keeper has the same obligation to return the goods as an ordinary bailee, except that he remains bound to observe the contractual storage duration even where an ordinary bailee would be entitled to return them sooner owing to unforeseen circumstances.

2 Where a document of title to goods has been issued, the warehouse keeper is entitled and obliged to release the goods only to the beneficiary named therein.

## [D. Inns, hotels and stables](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_19/lvl_D)

1 Innkeepers and hoteliers who provide accommodation for persons not known to them are liable for any damage, destruction or misappropriation of personal effects brought onto the premises by their guests unless they can prove that such damage is attributable to the guest himself or to his visitors, companions or staff or to force majeure or to the nature of the objects in question.

2 However, the liability for personal effects brought onto the premises by guests is subject to an upper limit of 1,000 francs for each guest where no fault can be ascribed to the innkeeper or hotelier or his staff.

## [2. Specific liability for valuables](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_19/lvl_D/lvl_I/lvl_2)

3 Where the guest cannot reasonably be expected to deposit such items, the innkeeper or hotelier is liable for them as for the other personal effects of the guest.

## [3. End of liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_19/lvl_D/lvl_I/lvl_3)

## [Title Twenty:](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20) [The Contract of Surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20)

## [A. Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_A)

## [I. Definition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_A/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 492**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_492)

1 Under a contract of surety, the surety undertakes as against the creditor of the principal debtor to vouch for performance of the obligation.

2 A contract of surety presupposes the existence of a valid primary obligation. A future or conditional obligation may be guaranteed by means of a contract of surety provided that the primary obligation takes effect.

3 A person standing surety for performance of an obligation resulting from a contract that is not binding on the principal debtor as a result of error or incapacity to make a contract is liable for such obligation, subject to the conditions and doctrines of the law governing surety, if he was aware of the defect vitiating the contract at the time he gave his commitment. The same applies to any person who stands surety for performance of an obligation that is time-barred for the principal debtor.

4 Unless the law provides otherwise, the surety may not waive in advance the rights conferred on him under this Title.

## [II. Form](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 493**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_493)

1 The contract of surety is valid only where the surety makes a written declaration and indicates in the surety bond the maximum amount for which he is liable.

2 Where the surety is a natural person, his declaration must additionally be done in the form of a public deed in conformity with the rules in force at the place where the instrument is drawn up. Where the liability under surety does not exceed the sum of 2,000 francs, it is sufficient for the surety to indicate the amount for which he is liable and the existence of joint and several liability, if any, in his own hand in the surety bond itself.

3 Contracts of surety in favour of the Confederation or its public institutions or in favour of a canton for the performance of public law obligations, such as customs duties, taxes and the like, and for freight charges merely require the written declaration of the surety and an indication in the surety bond itself of the amount for which he is liable.

4 Where the total liability is divided into smaller amounts in order to circumvent the formal requirement of a public deed, the formal requirements for contracts of surety for such partial amounts are the same as those prescribed for the total.

5 The sole formal requirement for subsequent amendments to the surety, except where the total liability is increased or the surety is transformed from a simple surety into a joint and several surety, is that they be done in writing. Where the principal obligation is assumed by a third party such that the debtor is released, the contract of surety is extinguished unless the surety has consented in writing to such assumption.

6 The formal requirements applicable to the contract of surety also apply to the conferral of special authority to enter into a contract of surety and the promise to stand surety for the contracting party or a third party. The parties may agree in writing to limit the surety’s liability to that portion of the principal obligation that is satisfied first.

7 The Federal Council may cap the fee payable for drawing up the surety bond as a public deed.

## [III. Spouse’s consent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 494**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_494)

1 A married person may validly stand as surety only with the written consent of his spouse given in advance or at the latest simultaneously, unless the spouses are separated by court judgment.

2 ... 

3 The spouse’s consent to subsequent amendments of a contract of surety is required only where the total liability is to be increased or a simple surety is to be transformed into a joint and several surety, or where the effect of the amendment is to diminish the level of security substantially.

4 The same applies *mutatis mutandis* to registered partners.

## [B. Substance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B)

## [I. Particularities of different types of surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I)

## [1. Simple surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 495**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_495)

1The creditor may resort to a simple surety only if, after the surety was provided, the debtor is declared bankrupt or obtains a debt restructuring moratorium, or is the object of debt enforcement proceedings instigated with due diligence by the creditor which have resulted in the issue of a definitive certificate of loss, or has relocated his domicile abroad and can no longer be sued in Switzerland, or legal action against him in foreign courts has been substantially impeded as a result of such relocation.

2 Where the claim is secured by pledges, a simple surety may require that the creditor satisfy his claim first from such pledges, provided the debtor has not been declared bankrupt or obtained a debt restructuring moratorium.

3 Where the surety has undertaken solely to cover any shortfall suffered by the creditor (indemnity bond), he may not be sued unless a definitive certificate of loss has been issued against the principal debtor or the latter has relocated his domicile abroad and can no longer be sued in Switzerland, or legal action against him in foreign courts has been substantially impeded as a result of such relocation. Where a composition agreement has been concluded, the surety may be sued for the remitted portion of the principal obligation immediately on the entry into force of the composition agreement.

4 Agreements to the contrary are reserved.

## [2. Joint and several surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 496**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_496)

1 Where a person stands surety for an obligation by appending the words “joint and several” or an equivalent phrase, the creditor may resort to him before suing the principal debtor and before realising property given in pledge provided the principal debtor has defaulted on his debt payments and has been issued with payment reminders to no avail or is manifestly insolvent.

2 The creditor may resort to the surety before realising pledged chattels and debts only to the extent that these are deemed by the court unlikely to cover the debt or where such sequence was agreed or where the debtor has been declared bankrupt or obtained a debt restructuring moratorium.

## [3. Co-surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 497**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_497)

1 Where two or more persons stand surety for a single divisible principal obligation, each of them is liable as simple surety for his share and as collateral surety for the shares of the others.

2 Where they have assumed joint and several liability by agreement with the principal debtor or among themselves, each of them is liable for the whole obligation. However, a co-surety may refuse to pay more than his share where debt enforcement proceedings have not been commenced against all other jointly and severally liable co-sureties who entered into the contract of surety before him or at the same time and who may be sued for the obligation in Switzerland. He has the same right if his co-sureties have paid their share or furnished real security. Unless otherwise agreed, a co-surety who has paid his share has a right of recourse against other jointly and severally liable co-sureties to the extent that each of them has not yet paid his share. This right may be exercised before recourse against the principal debtor.

3 Where it was apparent to the creditor that the surety entered into the contract on condition that others would stand surety with him for the same principal obligation, the surety is released if such condition is not fulfilled or if subsequently one of the co-sureties is released from his liability by the creditor or if his undertaking is declared invalid. In this last case the court may also, on grounds of equity, simply adjudicate that the surety’s liability be reduced by an appropriate amount.

4 Where several persons have independently agreed to stand surety for the same principal obligation, each of them is liable for the whole amount of his own commitment. However, unless otherwise agreed, a surety who pays such amount has a right of recourse against the others for their respective shares.

## [4. Collateral surety and counter-surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 498**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_498)

1 A collateral surety who stands surety to the creditor for performance of the obligation assumed by the primary surety is liable together with the latter in the same way as a simple surety is liable with the principal debtor.

2 A counter-surety stands surety for the right of recourse against the debtor accruing to the primary surety who honours his commitment.

## [II. Common provisions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

## [1. Relationship between the surety and the creditor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1)

## [a. Scope of liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 499**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_499)

1 In all cases, the surety’s liability is limited to the maximum amount indicated in the surety bond.

2 Unless otherwise agreed, he is liable up to this limit for:

  
1. the amount of the principal obligation, including the legal consequences of any fault or default on the part of the principal debtor, but not for damage resulting from the extinction of the contract and any contractual penalty unless this was expressly agreed;  
2. the costs of debt enforcement proceedings and legal action brought against the principal debtor, provided that the surety was given timely opportunity to avoid them by satisfying the creditor, and, where applicable, for the costs of delivering pledges and transferring liens;  
3. interest at the contractually agreed rate up to a maximum of the interest payable for the current year and the previous year or, where applicable, for the annual payments due for the current year and the previous year.

3 Unless otherwise provided by the contract or dictated by the circumstances, the surety is liable only for the principal debtor’s obligations arising after the contract of surety was concluded. 

## [b. Reduction of liability by court order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 500**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_500)

1 Unless otherwise agreed at the outset or by subsequent amendment, the amount for which a surety who is a natural person is liable decreases every year by three per cent or, where the claim is secured by mortgage, by one per cent of the original maximum liability. In all cases where the surety is a natural person, the amount decreases in at least the same proportion as the obligation.

2 This does not apply to contracts of surety in favour of the Confederation or its public institutions or in favour of a canton for the performance public law obligations such as customs duties, taxes and the like, and for freight charges, or to contracts of surety for the performance of official and civil service obligations or for obligations of variable amount, such as current accounts and contracts for delivery by instalments, and for periodic, recurrent obligations.

## [c. Resort to the surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_c)

###### [**Art. 501**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_501)

1 The creditor may not apply to the surety in respect of the principal obligation before the date fixed for its payment even if such date is brought forward following the principal debtor’s bankruptcy.

2 Under a contract of surety of any type, in exchange for furnishing real security, the surety may request that the court suspend the debt enforcement proceedings against him until all pledges have been realised and a definitive certificate of loss has been issued against the principal debtor or a composition agreement has been concluded with the creditors.

3 Where the principal obligation may not fall due without notice being served by the creditor or the principal debtor, the time limit for the surety does not commence until the date on which he receives such notice.

4 Where the obligation of a principal debtor residing abroad is annulled or restricted by foreign legislation, such as by provisions relating to clearing systems or a ban on currency transfers, a surety resident in Switzerland may also rely on such legislation unless he has waived this defence.

## [d. Defences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_d)

###### [**Art. 502**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_502)

1 The surety is entitled and obliged to plead against the creditor all defences open to the principal debtor or his heirs which are not based on the insolvency of the principal debtor. Suretyship for obligations that are not binding on the principal debtor owing to error or incapacity to make a contract or for time-barred obligations is reserved.

2 Where the principal debtor waives a defence that is open to him, the surety may nevertheless plead it.

3 Where the surety fails to plead defences open to the principal debtor, he forfeits his right of recourse to the extent that such defences would have released him from liability unless he can prove that he was unaware of them through no fault of his own.

4 A person who stands surety for an obligation that is not actionable because it stems from gambling or betting may plead the same defences as are open to the principal debtor even if he was aware of that defect.

## [e. Creditor’s duty of diligence and duty to release documents and pledges](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_e)

###### [**Art. 503**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_503)

1 Where the liens and other securities and preferential rights furnished when the contract of surety is concluded or subsequently obtained from the principal debtor for the specific purpose of securing the claim under surety are reduced by the creditor to the detriment of the surety, the latter’s liability is decreased by an equal amount unless it can be proven that the damage is less. Claims for restitution of the over-paid amount are unaffected.

2 Moreover, in the case of contracts of surety for the performance of official and civil service obligations, the creditor is liable to the surety if, as a result of his failure to supervise the employee as required or to act with the diligence that could reasonably be expected of him, the obligation arose or increased to an extent that it would not have otherwise reached.

3 On being satisfied by the surety, the creditor is required to furnish him with such documents and information as are required to exercise his rights. The creditor must also release to him the liens and other securities furnished when the contract of surety was concluded or subsequently obtained from the principal debtor for the specific purpose of securing the claim under surety or must take the requisite measures to facilitate their transfer. This does not apply to liens and rights of pledge held by the creditor in relation to other claims where they take precedence over those of the surety.

4 Where the creditor refuses without just cause to take such measures or has alienated the available evidence or the pledges and other securities for which he is responsible in bad faith or through gross negligence, the surety is released from his liability. He may demand the return of sums already paid and seek compensation for any further damage incurred.

## [f. Right to demand acceptance of payment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_f)

###### [**Art. 504**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_504)

1 As soon as the principal obligation falls due, even as a result of the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, the surety may at any time demand that the creditor accept satisfaction from him. Where several persons stand surety for an obligation, the creditor is obliged to accept even a part payment, provided it at least equals the share of the surety offering payment.

2 Where the creditor refuses without just cause to accept payment, the surety is released from his liability. In this event the liability of all other jointly and severally liable co-sureties is decreased by the amount of his share.

3 If the creditor is prepared to accept satisfaction, the surety may pay him even before the principal obligation falls due. However, the surety has no right of recourse against the principal debtor until the obligation falls due.

## [g. Creditor’s duty to notify and to register his claim in bankruptcy and composition proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1/lvl_g)

###### [**Art. 505**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_505)

1 Where the debtor is six months in arrears in the payment of capital, interest accrued over half a year or an annual repayment, the creditor must notify the surety. The creditor must inform the surety of the status of the principal obligation on request.

2 In the event of bankruptcy or composition proceedings concerning the principal debtor, the creditor must register his claim and do everything conscionable to safeguard his rights. He must inform the surety of the bankruptcy or debt restructuring moratorium as soon as he himself learns of it.

3 Should the creditor fail to take any of these actions, he forfeits his claims against the surety to the extent of any damage to the latter resulting from such failure.

## [2. Relationship between surety and principal debtor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

## [a. Right to security and release](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 506**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_506)

The surety may require that the principal debtor furnish security and demand his release from liability once the principal obligation falls due:

  
1. where the principal debtor breaches the agreements made with the surety, and in particular his promise to release the surety by a certain date;  
2. where the principal debtor is in default or has relocated his domicile abroad and legal action against him in foreign courts has been substantially impeded as a result;  
3. where the surety faces substantially greater risks than when he agreed to offer the surety because of a deterioration in the principal debtor’s financial situation, a decrease in the value of the security furnished or the fault of the principal debtor.

## [b. Surety’s right of recourse](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

## [aa. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_d20417e1869)

###### [**Art. 507**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_507)

1 The surety is subrogated to the creditor’s rights to the extent that he has satisfied him. The surety may exercise these as soon as the obligation falls due.

2 However, unless otherwise agreed, he is subrogated only to those liens and other securities which had been furnished when the contract of surety was concluded or were subsequently obtained from the principal debtor for the specific purpose of securing the claim. If on paying only part of the debt the surety is subrogated to only part of a lien, the part remaining with the creditor takes precedence over that of the surety.

3 Special claims and defences arising from the legal relationship between the surety and the principal debtor are reserved.

4 Where a pledge securing a claim under surety is realised or the owner of the pledge pays voluntarily, he may only have recourse against the surety for such payment where an agreement to this effect was reached between the pledgor and the surety or the pledge was given subsequently by a third party.

5 The prescriptive period for the surety’s right of recourse commences on satisfaction of the creditor by the surety.

6 The surety has no right of recourse against the principal debtor for payment of any obligation that is not actionable or not binding on the principal debtor as a result of error or incapacity to make a contract. However, if he has assumed liability for a time-barred obligation at the behest of the principal debtor, the latter is liable to him pursuant to the provisions governing agency.

## [bb. Surety’s duty to notify](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2/lvl_d20417e1871)

###### [**Art. 508**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_508)

1 Where the surety pays the principal obligation in full or in part, he must notify the principal debtor.

2 If he fails to do so and the principal debtor pays it again because he was not and could not be expected to be aware of the surety’s payment, the surety forfeits his right of recourse against the principal debtor.

3 This does not affect any claim against the creditor for unjust enrichment.

## [C. Termination of the contract of surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_C)

## [I. By operation of law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_C/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 509**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_509)

1 The surety is released as soon as the principal obligation is extinguished for whatever reason.

2 Where the same person is both principal debtor and surety, the creditor retains the special privileges conferred by the contract of surety.

3 Any surety given by a natural person is extinguished once twenty years have elapsed from the date on which the contract was entered into. This does not apply to contracts of surety in favour of the Confederation or its public institutions or in favour of a canton for the performance of public law obligations such as customs duties, taxes and the like, and for freight charges, or to contracts of surety for the performance of official and civil service obligations and for periodic, recurrent obligations.

4 During the final year of this period, the creditor may resort to the surety even where a longer duration was agreed for the contract of surety, unless the surety has previously extended the contract or replaced it with a new one.

5 The contract of surety may be extended by means of a written declaration by the surety for an additional period of no more than ten years. However, the written declaration is valid only if done no earlier than one year before the contract expires.

6 Where the principal obligation becomes payable less than two years before the contract of surety expires and the creditor was unable to give notice to terminate it sooner, under a contract of surety of any type the creditor is entitled to resort to the surety without prior recourse to the principal debtor or the pledges. However, the surety has a right of recourse against the principal debtor even before the principal obligation becomes payable.

## [II. Fixed-term contract of surety; revocation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 510**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_510)

1 A contract of surety for a future obligation may be revoked by the surety at any time by means of a written declaration to the creditor, provided that the obligation has not yet arisen, where the principal debtor’s financial situation has substantially deteriorated since the contract was concluded or where it subsequently transpires that his financial situation is substantially worse than the surety had in good faith assumed. Contracts of surety for the performance of official and civil service obligations may no longer be revoked once the official or civil service relationship has come into being.

2 The surety is liable to compensate the creditor for any damage resulting from the fact that he relied in good faith on the contract of surety.

3 Where a contract of surety is concluded for a fixed term, the surety’s liability is extinguished if the creditor fails to assert his claim at law within four weeks of the expiry of such term and to pursue it without significant interruption.

4 Where the obligation is not due at that juncture, the surety may exempt himself from liability only by furnishing real security.

5 If he fails to do so, the contract of surety remains valid, subject to the provision governing the maximum duration of contracts of surety, as if the agreed duration had been until the obligation falls due.

## [III. Open-ended contract of surety](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_C/lvl_II_I)

1 Where a contract of surety is concluded for an indefinite term, once the principal debtor’s obligation falls due the surety may, where action may be brought only on such conditions, request that the creditor assert his claim within a period of four weeks, instigate proceedings to realise any existing pledges and pursue his claim without significant interruption.

2 In the case of claims that fall due on expiry of a period of notice served by the creditor, once one year has elapsed since the contract of surety was concluded, the surety has the right to request that the creditor serve notice and, once the obligation is due, exercise his rights in accordance with para. 1.

3 The surety is released if the creditor does not comply with such request.

## [IV. Contracts of surety for official and civil service obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_20/lvl_C/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 512**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_512)

1 A contract of surety for the performance of official obligations concluded for an indefinite term may be terminated subject to one year’s notice expiring at the end of a term of office.

2 Where there is no fixed term of office, the surety may terminate the contract by giving one year’s notice expiring at the end of a four-year period commencing when the office was taken up.

3 A person standing surety for the performance of civil service obligations for an indefinite term has the same right to give notice of termination as under an open-ended contract of surety for official obligations.

4 Agreements to the contrary are unaffected.

1 A promissory note or bill of exchange signed by the gambler or bettor to cover the sum gambled or bet may not be enforced even following delivery of the instrument, subject to the rights that securities confer on bona fide third parties.

2 A voluntary payment may be reclaimed only where the intended gambling or betting activity could not take place as a result of chance occurrence or the actions of the recipient, or where the latter has committed an impropriety.

## [C. Lotteries and prize draws](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_21/lvl_C)

1 Lotteries and prize draws give rise to a claim only where they have been approved by the competent authority.

1 A life annuity may be created for the lifetime of the annuitant, the grantor or a third party.

2 In the absence of any specific agreement, the presumption is that it is settled for the life of the annuitant.

3 Unless otherwise agreed, an annuity settled for the life of the grantor or of a third party passes to the heirs of the annuitant.

## [II. Formal requirement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

1 Unless otherwise agreed, the life annuity is payable every six months in advance.

2 If the person on whom the life annuity is settled dies before the end of the period for which it is payable in advance, the grantor owes the full amount.

###### [**Art. 521**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_521)

1 A lifetime maintenance agreement is a contract in which the beneficiary undertakes to transfer an estate or individual assets to the settlor in return for an undertaking to provide maintenance and care for his lifetime.

2 If the settlor is appointed heir to the beneficiary, the entire relationship is subject to the provisions governing contracts of succession.

## [II. Conclusion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

## [1. Form](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 522**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_522)

1 The lifetime maintenance agreement must be done in the same form as a contract of succession, even where it does not involve the designation of an heir.

2 However, where it is concluded with a licensed care home on conditions approved by the competent authority, written form is sufficient.

## [2. Security](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 523**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_523)

A beneficiary who transfers land to the other party retains a statutory lien on the property as security for his claims in the same manner as a seller.

## [III. Content](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 524**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_524)

1 The beneficiary becomes part of the settlor’s household and the settlor is obliged to provide him such benefits as he might reasonably expect to receive in the light of the value of the assets transferred and his previous standard of living.

2 The settlor is obliged to provide the beneficiary with appropriate accommodation and maintenance and, in the event of his illness, with the necessary care and medical treatment.

3 Subject to approval by the competent authority, care homes may adopt house rules whereby such benefits are incorporated as generally binding contractual terms.

## [IV. Challenge and reduction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 525**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_525)

1 A lifetime maintenance agreement may be challenged by persons to whom the beneficiary has a legal duty of maintenance where conclusion of the agreement would deprive the beneficiary of the means of discharging such duty.

2 Instead of rescinding the agreement, the court may order the settlor to maintain such persons, with any such maintenance being brought into account against the benefits owed to the beneficiary under the lifetime maintenance agreement.

3 Actions in abatement by heirs and legal challenges by creditors are reserved.

## [V. Termination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_V)

## [1. Notice](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_V/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 526**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_526)

1 The lifetime maintenance agreement may be terminated by either party at any time subject to six months’ notice, where according to the agreement the performance of one party is substantially greater in value than that of the other and the party benefiting from such imbalance cannot show that the other intended it as a gift.

2 The decisive criterion here is the relation between the capital and the life annuity according to the principles applied by any reputable annuity institution.

3 Performance already rendered at the time of termination is returned after its capitalised value plus interest has been set off.

## [2. Unilateral termination](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_V/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 527**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_527)

1 Either party may unilaterally terminate the agreement where the relationship has become unconscionable as a result of breach of contractual obligations or where other good cause has rendered its continuation exceedingly difficult or impossible.

2 Where the agreement is terminated on such grounds, the party at fault must pay adequate compensation to the innocent party in addition to returning the performance received.

3 Instead of rescinding the agreement, at the request of one party or of its own accord the court may dissolve the joint household and award a life annuity to the beneficiary by way of compensation.

## [3. Termination on the death of the settlor](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_V/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 528**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_528)

1 On the death of the settlor the beneficiary may within one year insist that the agreement be terminated.

2 In this event, he has a claim against the heirs equivalent to the claim he would have in the event of the settlor’s bankruptcy.

## [VI. Non-transferable claim, asserting claim in the event of bankruptcy and seizure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_22/lvl_B/lvl_V_I)

###### [**Art. 529**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_529)

1 The beneficiary’s claim is non-transferable.

2 In the event of the settlor’s bankruptcy, the beneficiary has a claim equivalent to the capital that would be required to acquire from a reputable annuity institution a life annuity equal in value to the benefits owed to him by the settlor.

3 In the case of debt enforcement by attachment, the beneficiary may participate in the attachment in respect of this claim without need to bring prior enforcement proceedings.

1 Unless otherwise agreed, each partner has an equal share in profits and losses regardless of the nature and amount of his contribution.

2 Where only the partner’s share in the profits or his share in the losses is agreed, such agreement applies to both.

3 It is permitted to agree that a partner whose contribution to the common purpose consists of labour will participate in the profits but not in the losses.

1 All partners have the right to manage the partnership unless the task is entrusted exclusively to one or more partners or to third parties by agreement or resolution.

2 Where all or several partners have the right to manage the partnership, each of them may act without the involvement of the others, although every other partner authorised to manage the partnership has the right to object to and thereby forestall any management action before it is carried out.

3 The unanimous consent of all the partners is required to appoint a general attorney or to carry out transactions which transcend the scope of ordinary business, unless there is risk in delay.

## [V. Liability between partners](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_B/lvl_V)

3 By contrast, he is not entitled to remuneration for his personal services.

## [3. Due diligence](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_B/lvl_V/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 538**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_538)

2 He is liable to the other partners for any damage caused through his fault and may not set off against such damage the benefits obtained for the partnership in his other activities.

3 Managing partners who are remunerated for their management services are liable in accordance with the provisions governing agency.

###### [**Art. 545**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_545)

1 The partnership is dissolved:

  
1. where the purpose of the partnership has been achieved or become impossible to achieve;  
2. on the death of one of the partners, unless it was previously agreed that the partnership would continue with his heirs;  
3. where the share in the proceeds of liquidation of a partner is subject to compulsory sale or one of the partners is declared bankrupt or made subject to a general deputyship;  
4. by unanimous decision of the partners;  
5. on expiry of the period for which the partnership was established;  
6. by notice of termination served by one of the partners, where such right was reserved in the partnership agreement or the partnership was established for an indefinite duration or for the lifetime of one of the partners;  
7. by court judgment in cases of dissolution for good cause.

2 The dissolution of the partnership may be requested for good cause before the duration of the partnership agreement expires or, where it was established for an indefinite duration, with immediate effect.

## [2. Partnership of indefinite duration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_D/lvl_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 546**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_546)

1 Where the partnership was established for an indefinite duration or for the lifetime of one of the partners, each partner may terminate the partnership by giving six months’ notice.

2 Notice must be given in good faith and not at an inopportune juncture and, where an annual accounting period is envisaged, it must expire at the end of a financial year.

3 Where on expiry of the term for which it had been established the partnership is tacitly continued, it is deemed renewed for an indefinite duration.

## [II. Effect of dissolution on business management](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 547**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_547)

1 Where the partnership is dissolved for any reason other than notice of termination, a partner retains his authority to manage the partnership’s business until he learns of the dissolution or ought to have learned of it had he shown due diligence.

2 Where the partnership is dissolved on the death of a partner, the heir of the deceased must inform the other partners of his death without delay and continue in good faith to attend to the partnership affairs of the deceased until the requisite arrangements have been made.

3 The other partners must likewise continue to manage the partnership’s business in the interim.

1 Contributions to the partnership do not simply revert to those who made them in the liquidation that the partners must carry out after the partnership is dissolved.

2 However, each partner is entitled to the value for which his contribution was accepted.

3 Where no such value was determined, his claim is for the value of the contribution at the time it was made.

## [2. Division of surplus and deficit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_D/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

1 Where a surplus remains after satisfaction of partnership debts, reimbursement of the expenses incurred and advances made by each partner and return of the value of contributions, it is divided as profit among the partners.

2 Where, after satisfaction of debts and the reimbursement of expenses and advances, the partnership’s assets are not sufficient to cover the return of contributions, the shortfall is borne equally by the partners as a loss.

## [3. Liquidation method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_2/tit_23/lvl_D/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 550**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_550)

1 The liquidation following the dissolution of the partnership must be carried out jointly by all partners, including those without management authority.

2 However, where the partnership agreement related only to certain specific transactions to be carried out by one partner in his own name but on behalf of the partnership, that partner must carry out such transactions and give account of them to the other partners even after the partnership has been dissolved.

3 However, a partner may not be held personally liable for a partnership debt, even after he leaves the partnership, unless he has been declared bankrupt or the partnership has been dissolved or debt enforcement proceedings have been brought against it without success.

1 A personal creditor of a partner may not set off his claim against a debt owed to the partnership.

2 Similarly, a partner may not set off a debt to a personal creditor against any debt owed by the creditor to the partnership.

3 The dividend rights certificate must not have a nominal value; it must not be called a participation certificate or issued in exchange for a capital contribution stated as an asset in the balance sheet.

4 By operation of law, the beneficiaries under dividend rights certificates form a community to which the provisions governing the community of bond creditors apply *mutatis mutandis*. However, a decision to waive some or all rights under dividend rights certificates is binding only if taken by the holders of a majority of all such certificates in circulation.

5 Dividend rights certificates may be created in favour of the company’s founder members only by means of the original articles of association.

2 Provisions governing the composition of the shareholder group which are designed to safeguard the pursuit of the company’s objects or its economic independence are deemed to constitute good cause.

1 The assignment of shares in the cooperative and, where a certificate is issued as proof of membership or such share, the transfer of this certificate do not automatically make the acquirer a member. He becomes a member only after the existing members have passed a resolution of acceptance as required by law and the articles of association.

2 Until such time as the acquirer becomes a member, the alienator is entitled to exercise his personal membership rights.

3 Where membership of a cooperative is linked with a contract, the articles of association may stipulate that, if the contract is subsequently taken over, membership automatically passes to the legal successor.

## [II. By transfer of land or commercial exploitation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

###### [**Art. 859**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_859)

1 Unless the articles of association provide otherwise, any net profit on the cooperative’s business operations passes in its entirety to the society’s assets.

2 Where distribution of the net profit among the members is provided for, unless the articles of association dictate otherwise, it is distributed according to the use of the society’s facilities by individual members.

3 Where share certificates exist, the portion of the net profit paid out on them must not exceed the usual rate of interest for long-term loans without special security.

## [3. Duty to form and accumulate a reserve fund](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_D/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

1 Where the net profit is used for a purpose other than to build up the society’s assets, each year one twentieth of it must be allocated to a reserve fund. Such allocations must be made for at least 20 years; where share certificates exist, they must in any event be made until the reserve fund is equal to one-fifth of the society’s capital.

2 The articles of association may stipulate that the reserve fund must be accumulated more rapidly.

3 To the extent that the reserve fund does not exceed one-half of the society’s other assets or, where share certificates exist, one-half of the society’s capital, it may be used only to cover losses or for measures designed to sustain the society’s pursuit of its objects in difficult times.

1 Credit cooperatives may lay down articles of association that derogate from the provisions governing distribution of net profit contained in the previous articles, but they too are obliged to form a reserve fund and to use it in accordance with the above provisions.

2 Each year at least one-tenth of the net profit must be allocated to the reserve fund until it equals one-tenth of the cooperative’s nominal capital.

3 Where a portion of the net profit is paid out to holders of shares in the cooperative and that portion exceeds the usual rate of interest for long-term loans without special security, one-tenth of the amount by which it exceeds the usual interest rate must likewise be allocated to the reserve fund.

## [5. Welfare funds](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_D/lvl_II_I/lvl_5)

2 Where it is deemed appropriate in order to secure the long-term health of the cooperative, the general assembly of members may also resolve to create reserves which are not envisaged by or meet higher requirements than are specified by the law or the articles of association.

3 Similarly, contributions may be deducted from the net profit for the purpose of creating and financing welfare funds for employees, other workers and members or for other welfare purposes even where these are not envisaged in the articles of association; such contributions are subject to the provisions governing welfare funds established by the articles of association.

## [IV. Entitlement to settlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_D/lvl_I_V)

1 The articles of association determine whether the departing members or their heirs have claims on the society’s assets and, if so, what those claims are. Such claims must be calculated on the basis of the net balance sheet assets excluding reserves at the time the member leaves the cooperative.

2 The articles of association may grant the departing member or his heirs the right to the full or partial repayment of the value of his share certificate excluding the entry fee. They may stipulate that this repayment be deferred for up to three years after the member’s departure.

3 Even where the articles of association make no such provision, the cooperative remains entitled to defer the repayment for up to three years where it would cause the society considerable losses or jeopardise its continued existence. Any entitlement of the cooperative to a severance penalty paid by the departing member is unaffected by this provision.

4 The claims of the departing member or his heirs prescribe three years after the time at which the settlement becomes payable by the cooperative.

## [2. By law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_D/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

3 Where no payment is forthcoming on first request and the member fails to comply within one month of a second call for payment, he may be declared to have forfeited his rights as member of the cooperative, providing he was previously warned of this consequence by registered letter.

4 Unless the articles of association provide otherwise, the declaration of forfeiture does not release the member from obligations already due or falling due by virtue of his exclusion.

## [III. Liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

1 Instead of or in addition to such liability, the articles of association may require the members to make additional contributions, which may be used only to cover net losses for the year.

2 The liability to make additional contributions may be unlimited or else limited to specified amounts or to a specified proportion of the member’s contribution or share in the society.

3 Where the articles of association make no provision on how additional contributions are to be shared among the members, the amount due from each is determined according to the value of his share in the society or, where no such shares exist, on a per capita basis.

4 The additional contributions may be called in at any time. If the cooperative is insolvent, the right to call in additional contributions accrues to the insolvency administrators.

1 In the event of the insolvency of a cooperative in which the members are personally liable or liable to make additional contributions, at the same time as they draw up the schedule of claims the insolvency administrators must determine and call in the provisional personal liability of each individual member or the additional contributions he must make.

2 Irrecoverable amounts must be spread equally among the other members, and surpluses repaid once the final distribution plan has been formulated. The members’ right of recourse against each other is reserved.

4 Where a member’s personal liability or liability to make additional contributions is established or increased, on entry of the resolution in the commercial register it works in favour of all creditors of the cooperative.

## [g. Liability of new members](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_3/tit_29/chap_4/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_2/lvl_g)

###### [**Art. 958**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958)

1 Financial reporting is intended to present the economic position of the undertaking in such a manner that third parties can make a reliable assessment of the same.

2 The accounts are filed in the annual report. This contains the annual accounts (the financial statements of the individual entity), comprising the balance sheet, the profit and loss account and the notes to the accounts. The regulations for larger undertakings and corporate groups are reserved.

3 The annual report must be prepared within six months of the end of the financial year and submitted to the responsible management body or the responsible persons for approval. It must be signed by the chairperson of the supreme management or administrative body and the person responsible for financial reporting within the undertaking.

## [II. Principles of financial reporting](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

## [1. Going-concern assumption](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 958***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_a)

1 Financial reporting is based on the assumption that the undertaking will remain a going concern for the foreseeable future.

2 If it is intended or probably inevitable that all or some activities will cease in the next twelve months from the balance sheet date, then the financial reports for the relevant parts of undertaking must be based on realisable values. Provisions must be made for expenditures associated with ceasing activities.

3 Derogations from the going-concern assumption must be specified in the notes to the accounts; their influence on the economic position must be explained.

## [2. Chronological and material distinction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 958***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_b)

1 Expenditure and income must be entered separately depending on the date and nature of the transaction.

2 Provided the net proceeds from the sale of goods or services or financial income does not exceed 100,000 francs, accruals based on time may be dispensed with and instead based on expenditure and income.

## [III. Recognised financial reporting principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 958***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_c)

1 The following principles in particular apply to financial reports:

  
1. they must be clear and understandable;  
2. they must be complete;  
3. they must be reliable;  
4. they must include the essential information;  
5. they must be prudent;  
6. the same rules must be applied in presentation and valuation;  
7. assets and liabilities and income and expenditure may not be offset against each other.

2 The sum entered for the individual items on the balance sheet and in the notes to the account must be proven by an inventory or by some other method.

3 Financial reports must be adapted to the special features of the undertaking and the sector while retaining the statutory minimum content.

## [IV. Presentation, currency and language](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_C/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 958***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_d)

1 The balance sheet and the profit and loss account may be presented in account or in report form. Items that have no or a negligible value need not be shown separately.

2 In the annual accounts, the corresponding values of the previous year must be shown alongside the figures for the relevant financial year.

3 Financial reports are presented in the national currency or in the currency required for business operations. If the national currency is not used, the values must also be shown in the national currency. The exchange rates applied must be published in the notes to the accounts and if applicable explained.

4 Financial reports are presented in one of the official Swiss languages or in English.

## [D. Publication and inspection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_D)

###### [**Art. 958***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_e)

1 Following their approval by the competent management body, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts together with the audit reports must either be published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce or sent as an official copy to any person who requests the same within one year of their approval at his or her expense where the undertaking:

  
1. has outstanding debentures; or  
2. has equity securities listed on a stock market.

2 Other undertakings must allow creditors who prove a legitimate interest to inspect the annual report and the audit reports. In the event of a dispute, the court decides.

## [E. Keeping and retaining accounting records](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_1/lvl_E)

###### [**Art. 958***f*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_958_f)

1 The accounting records and the accounting vouchers together with the annual report and the audit report must be retained for ten years. The retention period begins on expiry of the financial year.

2 The annual report and the audit report must be retained in a written form and signed.

3 The accounting records and the accounting vouchers may be retained on paper, electronically or in a comparable manner, provided that correspondence with the underlying business transactions and circumstances is guaranteed thereby and provided they can be made readable again at any time.

4 The Federal Council shall issue regulations on the accounting records that must be kept, the principles for keeping and retaining them and on the information carriers that may be used.

### [Section Two: Annual Accounts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2)

## [A. Balance sheet](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_A)

## [I. Purpose of the balance sheet, duty to prepare a balance sheet and balance sheet eligibility](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 959**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_959)

1 The balance sheet shows the asset and financing position of the undertaking on the balance sheet date. It is structured into assets and liabilities.

2 Items must be entered on the balance sheet as assets if due to past events they may be disposed of, a cash inflow is probable and their value can be reliably estimated. Other assets may not be entered on the balance sheet.

3 Cash and cash equivalents and other assets that will probably become cash or cash equivalents assets or otherwise be realised within one year of the balance sheet date or within the normal operating cycle must be entered on the balance sheet as current assets. All other assets are entered on the balance sheet as capital assets.

4 Borrowed capital and shareholders’ equity must be entered on the balance sheet as liabilities.

5 Liabilities must be entered on the balance sheet as borrowed capital if they have been caused by past events, a cash outflow is probable and their value can be reliably estimated.

6 Liabilities must be entered on the balance sheet as current liabilities if they are expected to fall due for payment within one year of the balance sheet date or within the normal operating cycle. All other liabilities must be entered on the balance sheet as long-term liabilities.

7 The shareholders’ equity must be shown and structured in the required legal form.

## [II. Minimum structure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

3 Other items must be shown individually on the balance sheet or in the notes to the accounts, provided this is essential so that third parties can assess the asset or financing position or is customary as a result of the activity of the company.

4 Receivables and liabilities vis-à-vis direct or indirect participants and management bodies and vis-à-vis undertakings in which there is a direct or indirect participation must in each case be shown separately on the balance sheet or in the notes to the accounts.

## [B. Profit and loss account; minimum structure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_B)

###### [**Art. 959***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_959_b)

1 The profit and loss account presents the earnings of the company over the financial year. It may be prepared according to the period-based accounting method or the cost of sales method.

5 Other items must been shown individually in the profit and loss account or in the notes to the accounts to the extent that this is essential in order that third parties can assess the earning power or is customary as a result of the activity of the company.

## [C. Notes to the accounts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/annex_C)

###### [**Art. 959***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_959_c)

1 The notes to the annual accounts supplement and explain the other parts of the annual accounts. They contain:

  
1. details of the principles applied in the annual accounts where these are not specified by law;  
2. information, breakdowns and explanations relating to items on the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account;

If additional information is required in the regulations on the minimum structure of the balance sheet and profit and loss account and the notes to the accounts are dispensed with, this information must be shown directly on the balance sheet or in the profit and loss account.

4 Undertakings with outstanding debentures must provide information on the amounts concerned, interest rates, maturity dates and other conditions.

## [D. Valuation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D)

## [I. Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I)

###### [**Art. 960**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960)

1 Assets and liabilities are normally valued individually, provided they are significant and not normally consolidated as a group for valuation purposes due to their similarity.

2 Valuation must be carried out prudently, but this must not prevent the reliable assessment of the economic position of the undertaking.

3 If there are specific indications that assets have been overvalued or that provisions are too low, the values must be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.

## [II. Assets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

## [1. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 960***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960_a)

1 When first recorded, assets must be valued no higher than their acquisition or manufacturing costs.

2 In any subsequent valuation, assets must not be valued higher than their acquisition or manufacturing costs. Provisions on individual types of assets are reserved.

3 Loss in value due to usage or age must be taken into account through depreciation, while other losses in value must be taken into account through valuation adjustments. Depreciation and valuation adjustments must be applied in accordance with generally recognised commercial principles. They must be deducted directly or indirectly from the relevant assets and charged to the profit and loss account and may not be shown under liabilities.

4 For replacement purposes and to ensure the long-term prosperity of the undertaking, additional depreciation and valuation adjustments may be made. For the same purposes, the cancellation of depreciation and valuation adjustments that are no longer justified may be dispensed with.

## [2. Assets with observable market prices](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 960***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960_b)

1 In the subsequent valuation, assets with a stock exchange price or another observable market price in an active market may be valued at that price as of the balance sheet date, even if this price exceeds the nominal value or the acquisition value. Any person who exercises this right must value all assets in corresponding positions on the balance sheet that have an observable market price at the market price as of the balance sheet date. In the notes to the accounts, reference must be made to this valuation. The total value of the corresponding assets must be disclosed separately for securities and other assets with observable market price.

2 If assets are valued at the stock exchange price or at the market price as of the balance sheet date, a value adjustment to be charged to the profit and loss account may be made in order to take account of fluctuations in the price development. Such valuation adjustments are not permitted, however, if they would result in both the acquisition value and the lower market value being undercut. The total amount of fluctuation reserves must be shown separately on the balance sheet or in the notes to the accounts.

## [3. Inventories and non-invoiced services](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 960***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960_c)

1 If the realisable value in the subsequent valuation of inventories and non-invoiced services taking account of expected costs is less than the acquisition or manufacturing costs on balance sheet date, this value must be entered.

2 Inventories comprise raw materials, work in progress, finished goods and resale merchandise.

## [4. Capital assets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 960***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960_d)

1 Capital assets are assets that are acquired with the intention of using or holding them for the long-term.

2 Long-term means a period of more than twelve months.

3 Shareholdings are shares in the capital of another undertaking that are held for the long-term and confer a significant influence. This is presumed if the shares confer at least 20 per cent of the voting rights.

## [III. Liabilities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_II_I)

###### [**Art. 960***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_960_e)

1 Liabilities must be entered at their nominal value.

2 If past events lead to the expectation of a cash outflow in future financial years, the provisions probably required must be made and charged to the profit and loss account.

3 Provisions may also be made in particular for:

  
1. regularly incurred expenditures from guarantee commitments;  
2. renovations to tangible fixed assets;  
3. restructuring;  
4. securing the long-term prosperity of the undertaking.

4 Provisions that are no longer required need not be cancelled.

## [A. General](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_4/tit_32/chap_4/lvl_A)

###### [**Art. 962**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_962)

3 If a company with registered office in Switzerland is included in the group payments report that it or another company with registered office abroad has produced in accordance with the Swiss or equivalent regulations, it need not produce a separate report on payments made to state bodies. It must however in the Annex to the annual accounts indicate the other company in whose report it has been included, and publish this report.

4 Extraction includes all activities carried out by the company in the areas of exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction of minerals, oil and natural gas deposits and the harvesting of timber in primary forests.

G. Collective custody, global certificate and uncertificated securities

1 A bailee has the power to hold fungible negotiable securities from two or more bailors together in safe custody unless a bailor expressly requests that his securities be held separately.

2 If fungible negotiable securities are entrusted to a bailee for collective custody, the bailor acquires on deposit joint fractional title to the negotiable securities of the same class belonging to the collective holding. In order to determine the fractional share, the nominal value or in the case of securities without nominal value, the number of securities, is decisive.

3 A bailor has the right at any time, irrespective of the involvement or consent of the other bailors to withdraw negotiable securities from the collective holding to the extent of his share.

## [II. Global certificate](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

1 The obligor may issue global certificates or to replace two or more fungible negotiable securities entrusted to a single bailee with a global certificate, provided the conditions for issue or the articles of association of the company provide therefor or the bailors have consented thereto.

2 The global certificate is a negotiable security in the same form as the individual rights that it represents. It is jointly owned by the participant bailors, in proportion to their shares. The status and rights of the joint owners in relation to the global certificate are governed by Article 973*a* paragraph 2 *mutatis mutandis*.

1 The obligor may issue uncertificated securities or replace fungible negotiable securities or global certificates that have been entrusted to a single bailee with uncertificated securities provided the conditions for issue or the articles of association provide therefor or the bailors have consented thereto.

2 The obligor shall keep a book on the uncertificated securities that he has issued in which details of the number and denomination of the uncertificated securities issued and of the creditors are recorded. The book is not open for public inspection.

3 The uncertificated securities are created on entry in the book and continue to exist only in accordance with such entry.

4 The transfer of uncertificated securities requires a written declaration of assignment. Their pledging is governed by the provisions on the pledging of claims.

H. Ledger-based securities

1 A ledger-based security is a right which, in accordance with an agreement between the parties:

  
1. is registered in a securities ledger in accordance with paragraph 2; and  
2. may be exercised and transferred to others only via this securities ledger.

2 The securities ledger must meet the following requirements:

  
1. It uses technological processes to give the creditors, but not the obligor, power of disposal over their rights.  
2. Its integrity is secured through adequate technical and organisational measures, such as joint management by several independent participants, to protect it from unauthorised modification.  
3. The content of the rights, the functioning of the ledger and the registration agreement are recorded in the ledger or in linked accompanying data.  
4. Creditors can view relevant information and ledger entries, and check the integrity of the ledger contents relating to themselves without intervention by a third party.

3 The obligor must ensure that the securities ledger is organised in accordance with its intended purpose. In particular, it must be ensured that the ledger operates in accordance with the registration agreement at all times.

## [II. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

1 The obligor under a ledger-based security is entitled and obliged to render performance only to the creditor indicated in the securities ledger and subject to appropriate modification of the ledger.

2 By rendering the performance due at maturity to the creditor indicated in the securities ledger, the obligor is released from the obligation even if the indicated creditor is not the actual creditor, unless the obligor is guilty of malice or gross negligence.

3 When acquiring a ledger-based security in a securities ledger from the creditor indicated therein, the acquirer is protected even if the seller was not entitled to dispose of the ledger-based security, unless the acquirer acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.

4 The obligor may raise against a claim deriving from a ledger-based security only those objections which: 

  
1. are aimed at contesting the validity of the registration or derive from the securities ledger itself or its accompanying data;   
2. he or she is personally entitled to raise against the current creditor of the ledger-based security; or  
3. are based on the direct relations between the obligor and a former creditor of the ledger-based security, if the current creditor intentionally acted to the detriment of the obligor when acquiring the ledger-based security

## [III. Transfer](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_II_I)

The transfer of the ledger-based security is subject to the provisions of the registration agreement.

2 If the creditor of a ledger-based security is declared bankrupt, if his or her property is distrained or if a debt restructuring moratorium is authorised, the creditor's decisions regarding ledger-based securities are legally binding and effective against third parties, provided that they

  
1. were made beforehand;  
2. have become irrevocable under the rules of the securities ledger or another trading facility; and  
3. were actually recorded in the securities ledger within 24 hours.

3 When a bona fide acquirer of a certificated security and a bona fide acquirer of the ledger-based security have a conflicting claim to the same right, the former takes precedence over the latter.

## [IV. Collateral](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_I_V)

1 Collateral may be posted even without the transfer of the ledger-based security, if:

  
1. the collateral is visible in the securities ledger; and  
2. it is ensured that only the collateral recipient can dispose of the ledger-based security in the event of default.

2 In other respects:

  
1. the special lien on ledger-based securities is governed by the provisions on special liens that apply to certificated securities (Arts. 895–898 of the CC).  
2. the pledging of ledger-based securities is governed by the provisions on liens on debts and other rights as applicable for certificated securities (Arts. 899–906 of the CC).

## [V. Cancellation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_V)

###### [**Art. 973***h*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_973_h)

1 The beneficiary of a ledger-based security may demand that the court cancel the security, provided that he or she furnishes credible evidence of his or her original power of disposal and of the loss thereof. Following cancellation of the instrument, the beneficiary may also exercise his or her right outside the ledger or, at his or her own expense, demand that the obligor allocate a new ledger-based security. In addition, Articles 982-986 apply mutatis mutandis to the procedure for and effect of cancellation.

2 The parties may make provision for a simplified form of cancellation consisting in a reduction of the number of public calls for presentation or a curtailment of the time limits.

## [VI. Information and liability](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_1/lvl_F/lvl_V_I)

1. the content of the ledger-based security;  
2. the mode of operation of the securities ledger and the measures taken in accordance with Article 973*d* paragraphs 2 and 3 to protect the operation and integrity of the ledger.

2 The obligor is liable for damage to the acquirer arising out of information that is inaccurate, misleading or in breach of statutory requirements, unless the obligor can prove that he or she acted with due diligence.

3 Agreements which limit or exclude this liability are void.

1 A negotiable security is deemed a bearer security if the wording or form of the instrument shows that the current bearer is recognised as the beneficiary.

2 However, the obligor is no longer permitted to pay if subject to an attachment order served by a court or the police.

## [B. Obligor’s defences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_3/lvl_B)

1 Against a claim deriving from a bearer security, the obligor may plead only such defences as contest the validity of the instrument or arise from the instrument itself and those available to him personally against the respective obligee.

2 Defences based on the direct relations between the obligor and a former bearer are admissible where the bearer intentionally acted to the detriment of the obligor when acquiring the security.

3 The obligor may not plead the defence that the instrument entered circulation against his will.

## [II. In the case of bearer coupons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

1 Any bill of exchange may be transferred by endorsement even if it is not expressly made out to order.

2 Where the drawer has included the words “not to order” or a comment to that effect in the bill of exchange, the bill may be transferred only subject to the formal requirements and with the effects of a normal assignment.

3 The endorsement may also be made out to the drawee, regardless of whether he has accepted the bill or not, to the drawer or to any other party liable on it. Such persons may endorse the bill further.

## [2. Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

1 The endorsement must be written on the bill of exchange itself or on a sheet attached thereto (annex, rider). It must be signed by the endorser.

2 The endorsement need not designate the endorsee and may consist merely of the signature of the endorser (blank endorsement). In the latter case the endorsement is valid only if written on the reverse of the bill or on the annex.

## [4. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

## [a. Transfer function](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_a)

1. add his name or the name of another person to the endorsement;  
2. endorse the bill further by blank endorsement or endorsement to a specified person;  
3. negotiate the bill further without completing the blank endorsement and without endorsing it.

## [b. Guarantee function](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_b)

2 He may forbid further endorsement of the bill; in this case he is not liable to persons to whom the bill is further endorsed.

## [c. Proof of bearer’s entitlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_c)

###### [**Art. 1006**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1006)

1 A person possessing the bill is the holder in due course providing he can demonstrate his entitlement by means of an uninterrupted sequence of endorsements, even where the last is a blank endorsement. Deleted endorsements are deemed unwritten. Where a blank endorsement is followed by a further endorsement, it is presumed that the person who issued this endorsement acquired the bill by means of the blank endorsement.

2 Where the bill of exchange was somehow lost by a former holder, a new holder who can demonstrate his entitlement in accordance with the provisions of the previous paragraph is obliged to surrender the bill only if he acquired the bill in bad faith or was guilty of gross negligence when he acquired it.

## [5. Defences](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 1007**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1007)

A person to whom a bill of exchange is presented for collection may not plead against the holder such defences as are based on his direct relations with the drawer or a previous holder unless the current holder intentionally acted to the detriment of the obligor when acquiring the bill.

## [6. Procuration endorsement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_6)

###### [**Art. 1008**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1008)

1 Where the endorsement contains the comment “value for collection”, “for collection”, “per pro.” or some other comment expressing no more than authorisation, the holder may exercise all the rights under the bill of exchange; however, he may transfer it only by means of a further procuration endorsement.

2 In this case, the parties liable on a bill may plead against the holder only such defences as are available to them against the endorser.

3 The authority conferred by the procuration endorsement is not extinguished on the death or incapacity of the person conferring it.

## [7. Pledging endorsement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_7)

1 Where the endorsement contains the comment “value for security”, “value for pledge” or some other comment expressing a pledge, the holder may exercise all the rights under the bill of exchange; however, any endorsement issued by him only has the effect of a procuration endorsement.

2 The parties liable on a bill may not plead against the holder such defences as are based on his direct relations with the endorser unless the holder intentionally acted to the detriment of the obligor when acquiring the bill. 

## [8. Subsequent endorsement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_I/lvl_8)

###### [**Art. 1010**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1010)

1 An endorsement after maturity has the same effects as an endorsement prior to maturity. However, where the bill of exchange was endorsed only after protest for non-payment or after expiry of the time limit for protest, the endorsement only has the effects of a normal assignment.

2 Until the opposite is proven, it is presumed that an undated endorsement was made on the bill of exchange before the time limit for protest expired.

#### [III. Acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I)

2 He may prohibit presentation of the bill of exchange for acceptance where it is not domiciled with a third party or at a place other than the domicile of the drawee and is not an after-sight bill.

3 He may also stipulate that the bill of exchange must not be presented for acceptance prior to a specified date.

4 Unless the drawer has prohibited presentation for acceptance, any endorser may stipulate that the bill of exchange must be presented for acceptance, with or without a time limit.

1 The drawee may request that the bill of exchange be presented to him again on the day after the first presentation. The parties may invoke any failure to comply with this requirement only if the request is mentioned in the protest.

2 The holder is not obliged to leave a bill of exchange presented for acceptance in the drawee’s possession.

## [5. Form of acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 1015**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1015)

1 The declaration of acceptance is made on the bill of exchange. It is expressed through the word “accepted” or words to the same effect; it must be underlined by the drawee. The drawee is deemed to have declared his acceptance by merely appending his signature to the obverse of the bill of exchange.

2 Where the bill of exchange is an after-sight bill or must be presented for acceptance within a specified time limit owing to a special comment to that effect, the declaration of acceptance must indicate the date on which it is made, unless the holder requires that the date of presentation be indicated. Where no date is indicated, the holder must draw attention to this omission by timely protest in order to safeguard his right of recourse against the endorser and the drawer.

## [6. Restrictions on acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I/lvl_6)

###### [**Art. 1016**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1016)

1 The acceptance must be unconditional; however, the drawee may limit it to a portion of the bill amount.

2 Where the declaration of acceptance contains any terms that deviate from the provisions of the bill of exchange, acceptance is deemed to have been refused. However, the acceptor is liable according to the terms of his declaration of acceptance.

## [7. Domiciliate and bill domicile](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I/lvl_7)

###### [**Art. 1017**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1017)

1 Where the drawer has indicated on the bill of exchange a bill domicile other than the domicile of the drawee but without designating a third party by whom payment is to be made, the drawee may designate a third party when he declares acceptance. In the absence of such designation it is presumed that the acceptor himself has undertaken to pay the bill at its domicile.

2 Where the bill of exchange is domiciled with the drawee himself, he may designate in his declaration of acceptance an agent at the bill domicile by whom the payment will be made.

## [8. Effect of acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I/lvl_8)

###### [**Art. 1018**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1018)

1 Due to his acceptance, the drawee is obliged to pay the bill of exchange at maturity.

2 In the event of non-payment, the holder, even if he is the drawer, has a claim against the acceptor under the bill of exchange to any sums to which he is entitled pursuant to Articles 1045 and 1046.

## [b. In the case of deletion](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_II_I/lvl_8/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1019**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1019)

1 Where the drawee has struck out the declaration of acceptance made on the bill of exchange prior to returning the bill, acceptance is deemed to have been refused. Until the opposite is proven, it is presumed that such deletion was made prior to the return of the bill.

2 However, where the drawee has informed the holder or a person whose signature has been appended to the bill in writing of his acceptance, he is liable to such persons in accordance with the terms of his declaration of acceptance.

#### [IV. Bill Guarantees](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_V)

###### [**Art. 1021**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1021)

1 The guarantee commitment is inscribed on the bill of exchange or an annex (rider) thereto.

2 It is expressed by the words “as guarantor” or a comment to that effect; it must be signed by the bill guarantor.

3 The mere act of signing the obverse of the bill of exchange is deemed a guarantee commitment, providing the signature is not that of the drawee or the drawer.

4 The guarantee commitment must indicate for whom the guarantee is given; where there is no such indication, it is deemed to be given for the drawer.

## [3. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_V/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 1022**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1022)

1 The bill guarantor is liable in the same manner as the person for whom he has given the guarantee.

2 His commitment is valid even if the guaranteed obligation is void for any reason other than formal defect.

3 A bill guarantor who pays the bill of exchange acquires all rights thereunder against the person for whom he has given the guarantee and against all those who are liable to such person under the bill.

#### [V. Maturity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V)

## [1. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V/lvl_1)

###### [**Art. 1023**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1023)

1 A bill of exchange may be drawn:

on sight;

for a specified time after sight;

for a specified time after drawing;

on a specified date.

2 Bills of exchange with other maturity dates or with several consecutive maturity dates are void.

## [2. In the case of sight bills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V/lvl_2)

###### [**Art. 1024**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1024)

1 A sight bill is due on presentation. It must be presented for payment within one year of being drawn. The drawer may stipulate a shorter or longer time limit. The endorser may stipulate a shorter time limit for presentation.

2 The drawer may stipulate that the sight bill may not be presented for payment before a specified date. In this case the time limit for presentation commences on that date.

## [3. In the case of after-sight bills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 1025**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1025)

1 The maturity date of an after-sight bill is determined by the date indicated in the declaration of acceptance or the protest date.

2 Where no date is indicated in the declaration of acceptance and no protest is made, the bill is deemed to have been accepted on the last date of the time limit envisaged for presentation for acceptance as against the acceptor.

## [4. Computation of time limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 1026**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1026)

1 A bill of exchange made out for one or more months after it was drawn or after sight falls due on the corresponding day of the payment month. If there is no such day, the bill falls due on the last day of the month.

2 Where the bill of exchange is made out for one or more months plus half a month after it was drawn or after sight, the full months are counted first.

3 Where the maturity date is expressed as the beginning, middle or end of a month, such expression is deemed to mean the first, fifteenth or last day of the month.

4 The expressions ‘eight days’ or ‘fifteen days’ mean not one or two weeks but a full eight or fifteen days.

5 The expression ‘half-month’ means fifteen days.

## [5. Computation by the old method](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 1027**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1027)

1 Where a bill of exchange is payable on a certain date at a place where the calendar is different from that of the place of issue, the maturity date is determined according to the calendar of the bill domicile.

2 Where a bill drawn between two places with different calendars becomes payable when a specified time has elapsed since it was drawn, the date on which it was drawn is converted to the equivalent date in the calendar of the domicile and the maturity date computed according to the latter.

3 The provision set out in the previous paragraph applies *mutatis mutandis* to the computation of time limits for presentation of bills of exchange.

4 The provisions of this Article do not apply where a comment on the bill of exchange or any other term reveals that the parties intended otherwise.

#### [VI. Payment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V_I)

## [3. Payment before and at maturity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 1030**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1030)

1 The holder of the bill of exchange is not obliged to accept payment before maturity.

2 The drawee pays before maturity at his own risk.

3 A person paying at maturity is released from his obligations provided he is not guilty of malice or gross negligence. He is obliged to check that the sequence of endorsements is correct but is not required to verify the signatures of the endorsers.

## [4. Payment in foreign currency](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 1031**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1031)

1 Where the bill of exchange is denominated in a currency other than that of the bill domicile, the bill amount may be paid in the national currency at its value as at the maturity date. Where the obligor delays in making the payment, the holder is free to choose whether the bill amount is converted into the national currency at the rate that applies on the maturity date or the rate that applies on the payment date.

2 The value of the foreign currency is determined according to customary commercial practice at the bill domicile. However, the drawer may stipulate an exchange rate for the bill amount on the bill of exchange.

3 The provisions of the two previous paragraphs do not apply if the drawer has stipulated payment in a specified currency (actual currency clause).

4 Where the bill of exchange is denominated in a currency which has the same name but a different value in the country in which the bill was drawn and that in which it is payable, the presumption is that the currency meant is that of the bill domicile.

## [5. Deposit](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_V_I/lvl_5)

1 In the event of non-payment of a bill at maturity, the holder has right of recourse against the endorser, the drawer and the other parties liable on the bill.

2 The holder has the same right even before maturity:

  
1. where acceptance has been refused in part or in full;  
2. where the assets of the drawee are subject to insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether he has accepted the bill or not, or where only payments by the drawee have been suspended, or where compulsory execution has been levied on his assets without success;  
3. where the assets of the drawer of a bill of exchange whose presentation for acceptance is prohibited are subject to insolvency proceedings.

## [2. Protest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_2)

## [a. Time limits and requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_2/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 1034**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1034)

1 Any refusal of acceptance or of payment must be declared by public deed (protest for non-acceptance or for non-payment).

2 Protest for non-acceptance must be made within the time limit applicable for presentation for acceptance. Where, in the case of Article 1014 paragraph 1, the bill of exchange was presented for the first time on the last day of the time limit, protest may still be made on the following day.

3 In the case of bills of exchange payable on a specific day or for a certain time after they were drawn or after sight, protest for non-payment must be made on one of the two working days following the payment date. Protest for non-payment of sight bills must be made within the same time limits for protest for non-acceptance as envisaged in the previous paragraph.

4 Where protest for non-acceptance has been made, neither presentation for payment nor protest for non-payment is required.

5 Where the drawee has suspended his payments, regardless of whether he has accepted the bill of exchange or not, or compulsory execution has been levied on his assets without success, the holder may have recourse only once the bill has been presented to the drawee for payment and protest has been made.

6 Where the assets of the drawee, regardless of whether he has accepted the bill of exchange or not, or the assets of the drawer of a bill of exchange whose presentation for acceptance is prohibited are subject to insolvency proceedings, presentation of the court order commencing such proceedings is sufficient to exercise the right of recourse.

## [b. Responsibility](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_2/lvl_b)

1 The protest is made on a separate sheet attached to the bill of exchange.

2 Where the protest involves the presentation of several duplicates of the same bill of exchange or presentation of the original instrument and a copy of it, it is sufficient if the protest is attached to one of the duplicates or to the original bill.

3 A note to the effect that the protest is attached to one of the duplicates or to the original instrument must be made on the remaining duplicates or the copy.

## [e. For partial acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_2/lvl_e)

###### [**Art. 1038**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1038)

###### [**Art. 1041**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1041)

A protest signed by the competent notary or official body is valid even if not made in accordance with the regulations or if the information it contains is inaccurate.

## [3. Notification](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 1042**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1042)

1 The holder must notify the immediately preceding endorser and the drawer of the lack of acceptance or payment within four working days of the date on which the protest was made or, in the case of the comment “No protest”, within four working days of the date of presentation. Within two working days of receipt of such notification, every endorser must pass on the news received to the immediately preceding endorser and give him the names and addresses of the persons from whom he received it, and so on in sequence until the drawer. All time limits run as of receipt of the previous notification.

2 Where notification is made pursuant to the previous paragraph to a person whose signature is appended to the bill of exchange, the same notification must be made within the same time limit to his bill guarantor.

3 Where an endorser has omitted to give his address or has written it illegibly, it is sufficient if his immediately preceding endorser is notified.

4 The notification may be made in any form, including the mere return of the bill of exchange.

5 Persons under a duty to notify must show that they complied with it within the prescribed time limit. The time limit is deemed observed where a letter containing such notification was posted within the time limit.

6 A person who fails to notify in good time does not forfeit his right of recourse; he is liable for any losses arising from his failure to notify, but only up to the bill amount.

## [4. Waiver of protest](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_4)

###### [**Art. 1043**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1043)

1 By appending and signing the comment “No protest” or words to the same effect on the bill of exchange, the drawer and any endorser or bill guarantor may release the holder from his obligation to arrange protest for non-acceptance or non-payment in order to exercise his right of recourse.

2 The comment does not release the holder from the obligation to present the bill of exchange in good time and to make the requisite notification. The burden of proving that the time limit was not observed lies with any party relying on such point against the holder.

3 Where the comment was appended by the drawer, it is effective as against all parties liable on the bill; where it was appended by an endorser or a bill guarantor, it is effective only as against them. If the holder arranges for protest to be made in spite of the comment appended by the drawer, he must bear the costs. Where the comment was appended by an endorser or a bill guarantor, all parties liable on the bill must bear the costs of any protest made in spite of it.

## [5. Joint and several liability of the parties](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_5)

###### [**Art. 1044**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1044)

1 All parties who have drawn, accepted, endorsed or guaranteed a bill of exchange are liable as co-obligors towards the holder.

2 The holder may resort to any of them individually, severally or all together without being bound by the order in which they assumed their obligations.

3 The same right accrues to every party who has honoured the bill of exchange.

4 In asserting his claim against one party liable on a bill, the holder does not surrender his rights against the others or against the endorsers subsequent to such party.

## [6. Nature of recourse](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6)

## [a. By the holder](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 1045**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1045)

1 By way of recourse the holder may claim:

  
1. the bill amount, provided the bill has not been accepted or honoured, with any agreed interest;  
2. interest at a rate of six per cent since the maturity date;  
3. the costs of the protest and notifications and any other expenses;  
4. a commission of no more than one-third of one per cent.

2 Where recourse is had before maturity, interest is deducted from the bill amount. Such interest is calculated on the basis of the official (Swiss National Bank) discount rate obtaining at the domicile of the holder on the date on which recourse is had.

## [b. By the party honouring the bill](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1046**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1046)

A party that has honoured the bill of exchange may claim from his preceding endorsers:

  
1. the full amount he paid;  
2. the interest on such amount at a rate of six per cent since the date on which the bill was honoured;  
3. his expenses;  
4. a commission of no more than 2 thousandths.

## [c. Right to take possession of bill, protest and receipt](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6/lvl_c)

1 Any party liable on a bill against whom a recourse claim is or may be made is entitled to insist that the bill of exchange together with the protest and a receipted invoice be handed over to him against payment of the recourse amount.

2 Any endorser who has honoured the bill may delete his endorsement and those of the subsequent endorsers.

## [d. In respect of partial acceptance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6/lvl_d)

###### [**Art. 1048**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1048)

Where recourse is had following a partial acceptance, the party paying the unaccepted portion of the bill amount may insist that this be noted on the bill of exchange and a receipt for such portion be issued to him. Further, the holder must provide him with an authenticated copy of the bill of exchange and the protest to make further recourse possible.

## [e. Re-exchange bill](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_6/lvl_e)

###### [**Art. 1049**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1049)

1 A party with right of recourse may, where no comment to the contrary exists, exercise such right by drawing a new bill of exchange (re-exchange bill) on one of his preceding endorsers which is payable on sight and domiciled at the place of residence of the preceding endorser.

2 In addition to the amounts specified in Articles 1045 and 1046, the re-exchange bill includes the brokerage fee and the stamp duty for the re-exchange bill.

3 Where the re-exchange bill is drawn by the holder, the bill amount is dependent on the rate applicable to a sight bill drawn from the bill domicile of the original bill of exchange at the domicile of the preceding endorser. Where the re-exchange bill is drawn by an endorser, the bill amount is dependent on the rate applicable to a sight bill drawn from the domicile of the drawer of the re-exchange bill at the domicile of the preceding endorser. 

## [7. Invalidation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_7)

## [a. In general](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_7/lvl_a)

###### [**Art. 1050**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1050)

1 In the event that the holder fails to comply with the time limits

for presentation of a sight bill or an after-sight bill,

for protest for non-acceptance or for non-payment,

for presentation for payment of bills bearing the comment “No protest”,

he forfeits his rights against the endorser, the drawer and all other parties liable on the bill, with the exception of the acceptor.

2 In the event that the holder fails to comply with the time limit for presentation for acceptance prescribed by the drawer, he forfeits his right of recourse for non-acceptance and for non-payment, unless the wording of the comment shows that the drawer intended to exclude only liability for acceptance.

3 Where the time limit for presentation is indicated in an endorsement, only the endorser may rely on it.

## [b. Force majeure](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_7/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1051**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1051)

1 Where insuperable obstacles (statutory provisions enacted by a state or some other instance of force majeure) militate against the timely presentation of the bill of exchange or timely protest, the time limits for such actions are extended.

2 The holder is obliged to notify the immediately preceding endorser of the force majeure event without delay and to note such notification together with the date and place and his signature on the bill of exchange or an annex thereto; in other respects, the provisions set out in Article 1042 are applicable.

3 Once the force majeure ceases to apply, the holder must present the bill for acceptance or for payment without delay and, where necessary, make protest.

4 In the event that the force majeure lasts for longer than 30 days after maturity, recourse may be had without need for presentation or protest.

5 In the case of sight bills or after-sight bills, the thirty-day time limit commences on the date on which the holder notified the immediately preceding endorser of the force majeure event; such notification may be made even before expiry of the time limit for presentation. In the case of after-sight bills, the thirty-day time limit is extended by the fixed period after sight indicated on the bill of exchange.

6 Facts pertaining purely to the person of the holder or a person charged with the task of presenting the bill of exchange or making protest do not count as force majeure events.

## [c. Unjust enrichment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VI_I/lvl_7/lvl_c)

###### [**Art. 1052**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1052)

1 To the extent that the drawer of a bill of exchange and the acceptor are unjustly enriched to the detriment of the holder, they remain obliged to the holder even where their bill liability has prescribed or extinguished on account of failure to take the actions required by law to sustain the entitlement under the bill of exchange.

2 The claim for unjust enrichment also exists against the drawee, the domiciliate and the person or company for whose account the drawer issued the bill.

3 By contrast, no such claim exists against the endorsers whose bill liability is extinguished.

#### [VIII. Devolution of Cover](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_VII_I)

###### [**Art. 1053**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1053)

1 Where the drawer of a bill of exchange has been declared insolvent, any claim he holds under civil law against the drawee for restitution of cover or reimbursement of amounts paid devolves on the holder of the bill.

2 Where the drawer declares on the bill of exchange that he assigns his claims in respect of the cover provided, these devolve on the current holder of the bill.

3 Once the declaration of insolvency has been published or the assignment has been notified to him, the drawee may make payment only to the duly established holder against surrender of the bill of exchange.

#### [IX. Act of Honour](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X)

1 Acceptance for honour is permitted in all cases in which the holder has a right of recourse before maturity, except where presentation of the bill for acceptance is prohibited.

2 Where the bill of exchange indicates a person to act as acceptor or payer at the bill domicile in case of need, the holder has a right of recourse before maturity against the person who appended such emergency address and against subsequent endorsers only if he has presented the bill to the person indicated under such address and, in the event that acceptance for honour is refused, has had such refusal noted by means of protest.

3 In all other cases the holder may refuse acceptance for honour. However, if he admits it, he forfeits his right of recourse before maturity against the person in whose honour acceptance was declared and against subsequent endorsers.

## [b. Form](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1056**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1056)

The acceptance for honour is noted on the bill of exchange; it must be signed by the acceptor for honour. The declaration of acceptance must indicate the person for whom the acceptance for honour is made; absent such indication, it is deemed made for the drawer.

2 In spite of the acceptance for honour the party in whose honour the bill of exchange was accepted and his preceding endorsers may insist that the holder surrender the bill of exchange and the protest made, if any, together with a receipted invoice against reimbursement of the amount specified in Article 1045.

## [3. Payment for honour](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X/lvl_3)

###### [**Art. 1059**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1059)

1 Where the bill of exchange is accepted for honour by persons resident at the bill domicile or the persons indicated on the bill as being willing to pay in case of need are resident at the bill domicile, the holder must present the bill to all such persons no later than the day after the day on which the time limit for protest for non-payment expires and, where applicable, must arrange protest for failure to make payment for honour.

2 Any failure to make timely protest releases the person who appended the emergency address or in whose honour the bill was accepted and the subsequent endorsers.

## [c. Consequence of refusal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X/lvl_3/lvl_c)

###### [**Art. 1060**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1060)

Where the holder refuses payment for honour, he forfeits his right of recourse against those who would have been released.

## [d. Right to take possession of bill, protest and receipt](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X/lvl_3/lvl_d)

1 A note that the payment for honour has been received must be made on the bill of exchange, indicating the party for whom the payment was made. In the absence of such an indication, the payment is deemed made for the drawer.

2 The bill of exchange and any protest made are handed over to the payer for honour.

## [e. Devolution of the holder’s rights; multiple payments for honour](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_I_X/lvl_3/lvl_e)

###### [**Art. 1062**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1062)

1 The payer for honour acquires the rights under the bill against the party for whom he paid and against those liable to said party under the bill. However, he is not entitled to endorse it further.

2 The subsequent endorsers of the party in whose honour payment was made are released.

3 Where several payments for honour are offered, preference is given to those resulting in release of the largest number of parties liable on the bill. A person paying in honour in contravention of this provision and in full knowledge of the situation forfeits his right of recourse against those who would otherwise have been released.

#### [X. Production of Multiple Duplicates and Copies of Bills of Exchange](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_X)

1 The bill of exchange may be issued in multiple identical duplicates.

2 Such duplicates must be given serial numbers within the text on the instrument; otherwise, each duplicate counts as a separate bill of exchange.

3 Every holder of a bill of exchange may request that multiple duplicates be supplied to him at his own expense, provided the text of the bill of exchange does not stipulate that it was made out as a single copy. To do so, the holder must contact the preceding endorser immediately before him, who in turn must contact his immediately preceding endorser, and so on in sequence back to the drawer. The endorsers are obliged to repeat their endorsements on the newly issued duplicates.

## [b. Relationship between duplicates](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_X/lvl_1/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1064**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1064)

1 Where payment is made on one duplicate of the bill, the rights under all others are extinguished even if they do not bear a comment to the effect that payment on one renders all the others invalid. However, the drawee remains liable for any duplicate accepted that has not been returned to him.

2 Where an endorser has transferred the duplicates to a number of different persons, he and his subsequent endorsers are liable for duplicates bearing their signature which have not been surrendered.

## [c. Acceptance comment](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_4/lvl_X/lvl_1/lvl_c)

2 Where he refuses to surrender it, the holder has a right of recourse only after arranging for protest to be made, thereby confirming:

  
1. that the duplicate sent for acceptance was not surrendered to him on request;  
2. that neither acceptance nor payment was obtained on a different duplicate.

1 The custodian of the original bill must be indicated on the copy. The custodian is obliged to surrender the original bill to the rightful holder of the copy.

2 Where he refuses to surrender it, the holder has right of recourse against the endorsers of the copy and against persons who have appended a declaration of guarantee to it only after arranging for protest to be made, thereby confirming that the original bill was not surrendered to him on request.

3 Where the original bill bears the comment “henceforward endorsements valid only if made on copy” or a comment to that effect appended to the last endorsement before the copy was made, any subsequent endorsement added to the original bill is void.

1 A revocation of the cheque takes effect only after expiry of the time limit for presentation.

2 Where the cheque is not revoked, the drawee may make payment even after expiry of the time limit for presentation.

3 Where the drawer contends that he or a third party lost the cheque, he may forbid the drawee to cash it.

## [b. Death, incapacity, bankruptcy](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_I_V/lvl_5/lvl_b)

1 Where the cheque is denominated in a currency other than that of the place of payment, the cheque amount may be paid in the national currency at its value as at the date of presentation. Where payment is not made on presentation, the bearer is free to choose whether the cheque amount is converted into the national currency at the rate applicable on the date of presentation or the rate applicable on the payment date.

2 The value of the foreign currency is determined according to customary commercial practice at the place of payment. However, the drawer may stipulate an exchange rate for the bill amount on the bill of exchange.

3 The provisions of the two previous paragraphs are not applicable if the drawer has stipulated payment in a specified currency (actual currency clause).

4 Where the cheque is denominated in a currency which has the same name but a different value in the country in which the cheque was issued and that in which it is payable, the presumption is that the currency meant is that of the place of payment.

1 The drawer and any bearer may cross the cheque with the effects envisaged in Article 1124.

2 A cheque is crossed by drawing two parallel lines on its obverse. Such crossing may be general or specific.

3 The crossing is general if no indication or the comment “banker” or a comment to that effect is inserted between the two lines; it is specific if the name of a banker is inserted between the two lines.

4 A general crossing may be converted into a specific crossing, but not vice versa.

5 Any deletion of the crossing or of the name of the designated banker is deemed not done.

## [b. Effects](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_V/lvl_1/lvl_b)

1 A generally crossed cheque may be paid by the drawee only to a banker or a client of the drawee.

2 A specifically crossed cheque may be paid by the drawee only to the designated banker or, where the latter is himself the drawee, to his clients. However, the designated banker may entrust collection of the cheque to another banker.

3 A banker may acquire a crossed cheque only from one of his clients or from another banker. Further, he may collect such cheque only for the account of the aforementioned persons.

4 Where a cheque has been specifically crossed more than once, the drawee may honour the cheque only where it has been crossed not more than twice and one of the crossings was done for the purpose of collection by means of delivery to a clearing house.

5 A drawee or banker acting in contravention of the above provisions is liable for any losses caused thereby, albeit only up to the cheque amount.

## [2. Account-payee-only cheques](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_V/lvl_2)

1 The drawer and any bearer of a cheque may prohibit payment of the cheque in cash by appending the comment “account payee only” or a comment to that effect diagonally across the obverse of the cheque.

2 In this case the drawee may honour the cheque only by crediting the amount to an account (credit, transfer, debit settlement). The account credit is deemed payment.

3 Any deletion of the comment “account payee only” is deemed not to have been done.

4 A drawee acting in contravention of the above provisions is liable for any losses caused thereby, albeit only up to the cheque amount.

## [b. Bearer’s rights in the event of insolvency, suspension of payments, compulsory execution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_V/lvl_2/lvl_b)

###### [**Art. 1126**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1126)

1 However, where the drawee has been declared insolvent or has suspended its payments or debt enforcement proceedings have been brought against it without success, the bearer of an account-payee-only cheque has the right to demand cash payment of the cheque by the drawee and has a right of recourse. 

2 The same applies in the event that the bearer cannot obtain the account credit from the drawee as a result of measures taken pursuant to the Federal Act of 8 November 1934 on Banks and Savings Banks.

## [c. Bearer’s rights in the event of refusal of account credit or settlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_V/lvl_2/lvl_c)

1. by public deed (protest), or  
2. by means of a written and dated declaration made by the drawee on the cheque, including the date of presentation, or  
3. by means of a written and dated declaration made by a clearing house to the effect that the cheque was delivered in good time and not paid.

## [2. Protest, time limits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_V_I/lvl_2)

2. interest at a rate of six per cent since the date of presentation;  
3. the costs of the protest or equivalent declaration and of notifications, plus other expenses;  
4. a commission of not more than one-third of one per cent.

###### [**Art. 1131**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_1131)

1 Where insuperable obstacles (statutory provisions enacted by a state or some other instance of force majeure) militate against the timely presentation of the cheque or timely protest or equivalent declaration, the time limits for such actions are extended.

2 The bearer is obliged to notify the immediately preceding endorser of the force majeure event without delay and to note such notification together with the date and place and his signature on the cheque or an annex thereto; in other respects the provisions set out in Article 1042 are applicable.

3 Once the force majeure ceases to apply, the holder must present the cheque for acceptance or for payment without delay and, where necessary, make protest or similar declaration.

4 In the event that the force majeure lasts for longer than 15 days after the date on which the bearer himself notified the preceding endorser of the force majeure event prior to expiry of the time limit for presentation, recourse may be had without need for presentation or protest or similar declaration.

5 Facts pertaining purely to the person of the bearer or a person charged with the task of presenting the cheque or making protest or arranging for an equivalent declaration do not count as force majeure events.

#### [VII. Forged Cheques](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_VI_I)

Cheques may be issued in several identical duplicates if they are not made out to the bearer and are payable in a country other than the country of issue or in an overseas territory belonging to the country of issue, or vice versa, or are both issued and payable in an overseas territory, or are issued in one overseas territory and payable in a different overseas territory belonging to the same country. Such duplicates must be given serial numbers within the text on the instrument; otherwise, each duplicate counts as a separate cheque.

2. the time limit for presentation;  
3. whether a cheque may be accepted, certificated, confirmed or given a mark of approval and what the effects of such comments are;

8. the measures to be taken in the event of the loss or theft of the cheque;  
9. whether a protest or equivalent declaration is required to preserve the right of recourse against the endorser, the drawer and the other parties liable for the cheque.

## [c. Law of domicile](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#part_5/tit_33/chap_5/lvl_X_I/lvl_3/lvl_c)

The court shall grant the application if the shareholder proves his or her shareholder status.
