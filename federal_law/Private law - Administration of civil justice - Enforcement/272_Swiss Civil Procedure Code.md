 ###### [**Art. 261** Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_261)

 [1] The court shall order the interim measures required provided the applicant shows credibly that:

  
a. a right to which he or she is entitled has been violated or a violation is anticipated; and  
b. the violation threatens to cause not easily reparable harm to the applicant.

[2] The court may refrain from ordering interim measures if the opposing party provides appropriate security.

###### [**Art. 262** Subject matter](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_262)

 The court may order any interim measure suitable to prevent the imminent harm, in particular:

  
a. an injunction;  
b. an order to remedy an unlawful situation;  
c. an order to a register authority or to a third party;  
d. performance in kind;  
e. the payment of a sum of money in the cases provided by the law.

###### [**Art. 263** Measures ordered before the action becomes pending](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_263)

 If the principal action is not yet pending, the court shall set a deadline within which the applicant must file his or her action, subject to the ordered measure becoming automatically ineffective in the event of default.

###### [**Art. 264** Security and damages](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_264)

 [1] The court may make the interim measure conditional on the payment of security by the applicant if it is anticipated that the measures may cause loss or damage to the opposing party.

[2] The applicant is liable for any loss or damage caused by unjustified interim measures. If the applicant proves, however, that he or she applied for the measures in good faith, the court may reduce the damages or entirely release the applicant from liability.

[3] The security must be released once it is established that no action for damages will be filed; in case of uncertainty, the court shall set a deadline for filing the action.

###### [**Art. 265** *Ex-parte* interim measures](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_265)

 [1] In cases of special urgency, and in particular where there is a risk that the enforcement of the measure will be frustrated, the court may order the interim measure immediately and without hearing the opposing party.

[2] At the same time, the court shall summon the parties to a hearing, which must take place immediately, or set a deadline for the opposing party to comment in writing. Having heard the opposing party, the court shall decide on the application immediately.

[3] Before ordering interim measures, the court may *ex officio* order the applicant to provide security.

###### [**Art. 266** Measures against the media](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_266)

 The court may order interim measures against periodically published media only if:

  
a. the imminent violation of rights may cause the applicant a particularly serious disadvantage;  
b. the violation is obviously not justified; and  
c. the measure does not seem disproportionate.

###### [**Art. 267** Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_267)

 The court that orders the interim measure shall also take the required enforcement measures.

###### [**Art. 268** Modification and revocation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_268)

 [1] The interim measures may be modified or revoked if the circumstances have changed or if the measures have proven unjustified.

[2] The measures become automatically ineffective when the decision on the merits comes into force. The court may order their continuation if it serves the enforcement of the decision or if the law so provides.

###### [**Art. 269** Reservation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2010/262/en#art_269)

[1] Any person who has reason to believe that an ex-parte interim measure, an attachment under Articles 271–281 DEBA[] or any other measure against him or her will be applied for without prior hearing, may set out his or her position in advance by filing a protective letter.[]

[2] The opposing party shall be served with the protective letter only if he or she initiates the relevant proceedings.
