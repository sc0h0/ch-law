A spouse may seek a declaration of annulment if he or she:

  
1. temporarily lacked capacity of judgement at the time of the wedding;  
2. married in error, whether because he or she did not wish to marry at all or did not wish to marry the other person;  
3. contracted the marriage because he or she was intentionally deceived with regard to essential personal attributes of the other spouse;  
4. ...

[2] The provisions governing divorce apply *mutatis mutandis* to the effects of a court declaration of annulment on the spouses and their children.

[3] The presumption of paternity in favour of the husband does not apply if the marriage is annulled because it served to circumvent the provisions on the admission and residence of foreign nationals.

[1] A spouse who has changed his or her surname on marriage retains that surname following divorce; he or she may at any time declare before the civil registrar the wish to revert to the name by which he or she was known prior to the marriage.

##### [B. Marital property law and inheritance law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_B)

##### [C. Family home](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_C)

[**Art. 121**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_121) 

[1] If a spouse must remain in the family home because of the children or for other compelling reasons, the court may transfer the rights and obligations under the tenancy agreement to that spouse provided this is not inequitable for the other.

[2] The previous tenant is jointly and severally liable for payment of the rent up to the date on which the tenancy ends or may be terminated pursuant to the tenancy agreement or by law, but for a maximum period of two years; if an action is brought to recover rent due, he or she is entitled to set off the amount paid in instalments equal to the amount of the monthly rent against any maintenance payments owed to the other spouse.

[3] If the home belongs to the family of one of the spouses, the court may, on the same conditions, grant the other spouse a right of residence for a fixed term in return for reasonable compensation or set-off against maintenance payments. Where new and compelling reasons so require, such right of residence may be restricted or revoked.

##### [D. Occupational pensions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D)

###### [I. Principle](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I)

[**Art. 122**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_122)

In the event of divorce, any occupational pension assets accrued during the marriage up to the point at which divorce proceedings commence are divided equitably. 

###### [II. Equitable division of termination benefits](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 123**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_123)

[1] Termination benefits including vested benefits and early withdrawals for purchasing owner-occupied property are divided equally.

[2] Paragraph 1 does not apply to one-off contributions from individual property in accordance with the law.

[3] The termination benefits to be divided are calculated on the basis of Articles 15–17 and 22*a* or 22*b* of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993.

###### [III. Equitable division of invalidity pension prior to statutory retirement age](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 124**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124)

[1] If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is drawing an invalidity pension prior to the statutory retirement age, the amount to which he or she would be entitled under Article 2 paragraph 1[ter] of the Vested Benefits Act of 17 December 1993 following cancellation of the invalidity pension counts as the termination benefits.

[2] The provisions on the equitable division of termination benefits apply *mutatis mutandis*.

[3] The Federal Council determines in which cases the amount under paragraph 1 may not be applied in the division because there has been a reduction due to over-compensation.

###### [IV. Equitable division in the case of invalidity pensions after statutory retirement age and in the case of retirement pensions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_I_V)

[**Art. 124***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_a)

[1] If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is drawing an invalidity pension after the statutory retirement age or drawing a retirement pension, the court decides at its own discretion how the pension is to be divided. In doing so it primarily takes into account the duration of the marriage and the pension requirements of each spouse.

[2] The share of the pension awarded to the spouse entitled thereto is converted into a life-long pension. This is paid to the entitled spouse by the liable spouse’s occupational pension fund or is transferred to the entitled spouse’s own occupational pension fund.

[3] The Federal Council regulates:

  
1. the actuarial conversion of the share of the pension into a life-long pension;  
2. the procedure in cases in which the retirement benefits are postponed or the invalidity pension is reduced due to over-compensation.

###### [V. Exceptions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_V)

[**Art. 124***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_b)

[1] The spouses may, in an agreement on the consequences of the divorce, agree not to divide the assets equally or not to divide them at all if there are sufficient retirement pension and invalidity pension funds otherwise.

[2] The court may award the entitled spouse less than half of the termination benefits or rule that they should not be divided if good cause exists. Good cause exists above all when equal division would be unreasonable:

  
1. in view of the division of marital property or the economic circumstances following divorce;  
2. in view of the pension requirements, in particular with regard to the difference in age between the spouses. 

[3] The court may award the entitled spouse more than half of the termination benefits if he or she cares for joint children following the divorce and the liable spouse continues to have sufficient retirement and invalidity pension assets.

###### [VI. Offset of mutual entitlements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_V_I)

[**Art. 124***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_c)

[1] The spouses’ mutual entitlements to termination benefits or a share of a pension are offset. The pension entitlement is offset before the share of the pension awarded to the entitled spouse is converted into a life-long pension.

[2] Termination benefits may only be offset against a share of a pension if the spouses and the occupational pension institutions agree.

###### [VII. Unreasonableness](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_VI_I)

[**Art. 124***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_d)

If, having considered the pension requirements of both spouses, an equitable division of occupational pension assets is unreasonable, the liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse a lump sum payment.

###### [VIII. Impossibility](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_D/lvl_VII_I)

[**Art. 124***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_124_e)

[1] If the equitable division of pension fund assets is not possible, the liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse adequate compensation in the form of a lump sum payment or as a pension.

[2] A Swiss judgment may be amended at the request of the liable spouse if pension entitlements existing abroad have been offset by adequate compensation pursuant to paragraph 1 and such pension entitlements are then divided up in a foreign decision that is binding on the foreign party liable to pay pension contributions.

##### [E. Post-marital maintenance](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E)

###### [I. Requirements](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I)

[**Art. 125**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_125) 

[1] If a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to provide for his or her own maintenance, including an appropriate level of retirement provision, the other spouse must pay a suitable contribution.

[2] In deciding whether such a contribution is to be made and, if so, in what amount and for how long, the following factors in particular must be considered:

  
1. the division of duties during the marriage;  
2. the duration of the marriage;  
3. the standard of living during the marriage;  
4. the age and health of the spouses;  
5. the income and assets of the spouses;  
6. the extent and duration of child care still required of the spouses;  
7. the vocational training and career prospects of the spouses and the likely cost of reintegration into working life;  
8. expectancy of federal old age and survivor’s insurance benefits and of occupational or other private or state pensions, including the expected proceeds of any division of withdrawal benefits.

[3] Exceptionally, a maintenance contribution may be denied or reduced if it would clearly be inequitable, particularly because the spouse otherwise entitled to receive such contribution:

  
1. has grossly neglected his or her duty to contribute to the maintenance of the family;  
2. has wilfully brought about his or her own indigence;  
3. has committed a serious criminal offence against the other spouse or a person close to him or her.

###### [II. Modalities of maintenance contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 126**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_126) 

[1] The court shall fix an amount to be paid periodically by way of maintenance contribution and set the date on which the duty of maintenance commences.

[2] Where justified in specific circumstances, a lump sum settlement may be ordered instead of regular payments.

[3] The court may attach conditions to the maintenance contribution.

###### [III. Regular payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 127**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_127) 

The spouses may wholly or in part exclude any alteration of the regular maintenance payments stipulated in the agreement.

###### [2. Adjustment for inflation](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 128**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_128) 

The court may direct that the maintenance contribution will automatically increase or decrease depending on specified changes in the cost of living.

###### [3. Adjustment by court order](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_3)

[**Art. 129**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_129) 

[1] In the event of a substantial and enduring change in circumstances, the periodic maintenance payments may be reduced, cancelled or suspended for a certain time; an improvement in the circumstances of the party entitled to maintenance may be taken into account only if the payments stipulated in the divorce decree provided sufficient maintenance.

[2] The party entitled to maintenance may request that the payments be adjusted in line with future inflation if the income of the other party has increased unexpectedly since the divorce.

[3] Within five years of the divorce, the party entitled to maintenance may request that payments be ordered or increased provided the divorce decree states that it was not possible at that time to order sufficient maintenance payments and provided the economic circumstances of the party obliged to pay maintenance have since improved.

###### [4. Expiry by law](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_II_I/lvl_4)

[**Art. 130**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_130) 

[1] The duty to pay maintenance expires on the death of either the receiving party or the paying party.

[2] Unless otherwise agreed, it likewise expires on the remarriage of the party entitled to receive maintenance.

###### [IV. Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_V)

[**Art. 131**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_131)

[1] Where the liable party fails to pay maintenance, an official agency designated by cantonal law shall on request, in an appropriate way and usually without charge, assist the party entitled to maintenance to enforce his or her claims.

[2] The Federal Council determines the terms of enforcement assistance.

###### [2. Advance payments](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

[**Art. 131***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_131_a)

[1] Public law may provide for advance payments to be made should the liable person fail to make the necessary maintenance payments.

[2] If the state authority makes maintenance payments to the entitled person, the maintenance entitlement with all rights is assigned to the state authority.

###### [3. Directions to debtors and posting security](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_E/lvl_I_V/lvl_3)

[**Art. 132**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_132) 

[1] If the party obliged to pay maintenance fails to do so, the court may order his debtors to make payment in whole or in part to the party entitled to maintenance.

[2] If the party obliged to pay maintenance persistently fails to do so, or if there are grounds to suspect that said party is preparing to abscond or is dissipating or concealing his assets, the court may order him to post appropriate security for future maintenance contributions.

##### [F. Children](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_F)

###### [I. Parental rights and obligations](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_F/lvl_I)

[**Art. 133**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_133)

[1] The court regulates parental rights and obligations in accordance with the provisions on the legal effects of the parent-child relationship. In particular it regulates:

  
1. parental responsibility;  
2. residence;  
3. contact (Art. 273) or the sharing of parenting duties; and  
4. child maintenance contributions.

[2] It shall consider all circumstances important to the child's best interests. It shall take account of a joint proposal by the parents and, if feasible, the opinion of the child.

[3] It may order that the child maintenance contribution continue to be paid after the child reaches the age of majority.

###### [II. Change of circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_1/tit_4/chap_3/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

[2] The requirements for the modification of other parental rights and -obligations are governed by the provisions on the effects of the parent-child relationship.

[3] If the parents agree, the child protection authority reassesses parental responsibility, residence and approves a child support agreement. In the other cases, the court competent to modify the divorce decree decides.

[4] If the court is required to decide on the modification of parental responsibility, residence or the child maintenance contribution for a minor child, it shall if necessary also reassess contact or sharing of parenting duties; in the other cases, the child protection authority shall decide on the modification of contact or sharing of parenting duties.

[2] The same applies if a spouse has contributed significantly more of his or her own income or assets to the maintenance of the family than he or she was obliged to contribute.

[3] However, a spouse is not entitled to compensation if such extraordinary contribution was made under a work, loan or partnership agreement or on the basis of some other legal relationship.

[1] Where a child was born within 300 days of the dissolution of the marriage as a result of death and the mother has since remarried, the second husband is deemed to be the father.

[2] If this presumption is disproved, the first husband is deemed to be the father.

2. by the child or, after his or her death, by his or her issue if the spouses ceased living together while the child was still a minor or if recognition did not occur until after the child's twelfth birthday;  
3. by the husband’s commune of origin or residence;  
4. by the husband.

[3] The provisions governing challenge of recognition apply *mutatis mutandis*.

[1] The duty of maintenance towards a minor shall take precedence over other maintenance duties under family law. 

[2] In justified cases, the court may disregard this rule, in particular in order to prevent any disadvantage to a child entitled to maintenance who is of age.

[**Art. 285**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_285)

[1] The child maintenance contribution should correspond to the child’s needs and to the parents’ financial circumstances and resources; the child’s assets and income must be taken into account.

[3] The child maintenance contribution is payable in advance on the dates stipulated by the court.

###### [2. Other payments for maintenance of the child](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_V/lvl_2)

[1] Family allowance credits paid to the parent required to pay maintenance must be paid in addition to the maintenance. 

[2] Unless the court rules otherwise, any child allowance, social security children’s supplement and similar child support benefits to which the parent subject to the duty of maintenance is entitled must be paid in addition to the child maintenance contribution.

[3] Where as a result of old age or invalidity the parent subject to the duty of maintenance subsequently receives social security, children’s supplements or similar child support benefits which replace his or her employment income, he or she must pay said benefits to the child; by operation of law, his or her existing child maintenance contribution is automatically reduced by the amount of such new benefits.

###### [V. Change of circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_V)

[3] Should the child have unforeseen, extraordinary needs the court may order the parents to make a special financial contribution.

###### [2. Shortfalls](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_V/lvl_2)

[1] If it was previously established in an approved maintenance agreement or a decision that no maintenance contribution could be set to provide due maintenance for the child, and should the circumstances of the parent liable to pay maintenance have since improved substantially, the child is entitled to claim payments that were not met by this parent during the previous five years in which payments were owed to provide due maintenance.

[2] This claim must be brought within one year of it being known that the circumstances have improved substantially. 

[3] This claim passes with all rights to the other parent or to the state authority in as far as this parent or the state authority has met the missing share of the due maintenance.

[3] If the agreement is concluded in court proceedings, such approval must be given by the court.

###### [II. Scope of a maintenance agreement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_E/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 287***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_287_a)

the amount required to cover any shortfall in the due maintenance of each child;   
if and to what extent the maintenance contributions will be adjusted to reflect changes in living costs. 

###### [III. Final settlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_E/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 289**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_289)

[1] The right to child maintenance contributions is that of the child and, so long as he or she is a minor, is fulfilled by payment to the child's legal representative or to the person with whom the child resides, unless the court decides otherwise.

[2] However, where the state authority assumes the cost of maintaining the child, such claim and all attendant rights pass to the state authority.

###### [II. Enforcement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_2/lvl_F/lvl_I_I)

##### [A. Principles](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A)

[**Art. 296**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_296)

[1] Parental responsibility serves the best interests of the child.

[2] Until such time as they attain the age of majority, children remain the joint parental responsibility of their father and mother.

[3] Parents who are minors or subject to a general deputyship may not exercise parental responsibility. When the parents attain the age of majority, they are assigned parental responsibility. If the general deputyship is revoked, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility in a manner appropriate to the child's best interests.

##### [A[bis]. Death of a parent](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_bis)

[**Art. 297**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_297)

[1] If the parents have joint parental responsibility and one parent dies, the surviving parent retains sole parental responsibility.

[2] If a parent who has sole parental responsibility dies, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility to the surviving parent or if a legal guardian is appointed for the child, to the person more suited to safeguarding the child's best interests.

##### [A[ter]. Divorce and other marital proceedings](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_ter)

[**Art. 298**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298)

[1] In divorce proceedings or proceedings to protect the marital union, the court shall assign one parent sole parental responsibility if this is necessary to safeguard the child's best interests.

[2] It may limit itself to regulating residence, contact or sharing of parenting duties if there is no prospect of the parents agreeing on these matters.

[2bis] When regulating residence, contact and the sharing of parenting duties it shall take account of the right of the child to maintain regular personal relationships with both parents.

[2ter] Where joint parental responsibility is awarded, with respect to the child’s best interests, it shall consider the possibility of the child residing with both parents on an alternating basis, if this is requested by one of the parents or by the child.

[3] It shall request the child protection authority to appoint a legal guardian for the child if neither the mother nor the father can be expected to accept parental responsibility.

##### [A[quater]. Recognition and court declaration of paternity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater)

[**Art. 298***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_a)

[1] If the parents are not married to each other and if the father recognises the child, or the parent-child relationship is established by court judgment but joint parental responsibility was not ordered at the time of the judgment, joint parental responsibility is established based on a joint declaration by the parents.

[2] In the declaration, the parents confirm that they:

  
1. are prepared to accept joint responsibility for the child; and  
2. have agreed on residence and contact or on the sharing of parenting duties and on the child maintenance contribution for the child.

[3] Before making the declaration, the parents may seek advice from the child protection authority.

[4] If the parents make the declaration at the same time as recognising paternity, the declaration is made to the civil registrar. A subsequent declaration must be made to the child protection authority at the child's domicile.

[5] Unless and until the declaration has been made, the mother has sole parental responsibility.

###### [II. Decision of the child protection authority](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 298***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_b)

[1] If a parent refuses to make a declaration on joint parental responsibility, the other parent may request the child protection authority at the child's domicile to intervene.

[2] The child protection authority shall order joint parental responsibility, unless the mother should retain sole parental responsibility or sole parental responsibility should be assigned to the father in order to safeguard the child's best interests.

[3] At the same time as deciding on parental responsibility, the child protection authority shall regulate any other matters in dispute. An action for payment of the maintenance contribution may be brought before the competent court; in such a case the court also decides on parental responsibility and other matters relating to the child.

[3bis] In its decision on residence, contact and the sharing of parenting duties, the child protection authority shall take account of the right of the child to maintain regular personal relationships with both parents.

[3ter] Where joint parental responsibility is awarded, with respect to the child’s best interests, it shall consider the possibility of the child residing with both parents on an alternating basis, if this is requested by one of the parents or by the child.

[4] If the mother is a minor or subject to a general deputyship, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility to the father or appoint a legal guardian for the child, depending on which measure is more suitable to safeguard the child's best interests.

###### [III. Paternity action](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater/lvl_II_I)

###### [IV. Change in circumstances](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quater/lvl_I_V)

[**Art. 298***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_d)

[1] At the request of either parent, the child or *ex officio*, the child protection authority shall reassign parental responsibility if this is necessary to safeguard the child's best interests due to a substantial change in circumstances.

[2] It may limit itself to regulating residence, contact or the sharing of parenting duties.

[3] An action for a change to the maintenance payments may be brought to the competent court; in such a case the court may make a new ruling on parental responsibility and other matters relating to the child.

##### [A[quinquies]. Change in the situation after the adoption of a stepchild in a cohabitation relationship](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_quinquies)

[**Art. 298***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_298_e)

If the person who adopts the child cohabits with the child’s mother or father, and there is a substantial change in the circumstances, the provision on the change of circumstances applies mutatis mutandis in the case of recognition and judgement of paternity.

##### [A[sexies]. Step-parents](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_2/part_2/tit_8/chap_3/lvl_A_sexies)

[**Art. 301**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_301)

[1] The parents raise and care for a child with his or her best interests in mind and take all necessary decisions unless the child has capacity to act.

[1bis] The parent who is taking care of the child may decide alone if:

  
1. the matter is routine or urgent;  
2. the other parent cannot be consulted without incurring unreasonable trouble or expense.

[2] The child owes his or her parents obedience; according to how mature the child is, the parents shall allow the child the freedom to shape his or her own life and, wherever feasible, take due account of the child’s opinion in important matters.

[3] The child is not permitted to leave the family home without the parents’ consent, nor may he or she be unlawfully removed from them.

[4] The parents give the child his or her first name.

[**Art. 301***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_301_a)

[1] Parental responsibility includes the right to decide on the child's place of residence.

[2] If parents exercise joint parental responsibility and if one parent wishes to change the child's place of residence, this requires the consent of the other parent or a decision of the court or the child protection authority if:

  
a. the new place of residence is outside Switzerland; or  
b. the change of place of residence has serious consequences for the ability of the other parent to exercise parental responsibility and have contact.

[2] At the request of the parents or the child, the child protection authority must do likewise if relations between them have deteriorated to the extent that it is no longer conscionable for the child to remain in the family home and provided no other practical remedy is available in the circumstances.

[3] Where a child has lived for some length of time with foster parents, the child protection authority may forbid the parents to take the child back if such action might pose a serious risk to the child’s development.

[d. Drawing up a will without the testator reading and signing it](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_4/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_2/lvl_d) [**Art. 502**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_502) 

[1] If the testator does not read and sign the deed, the official must read it out in the presence of the two witnesses and the testator, who must then declare that the deed contains his or her will.

[1] Where the testator is prevented from using any other form of will by extraordinary circumstances such as the imminent risk of death, breakdown in communications, epidemic or war, he or she is entitled to make a will in oral form.

[2] To do so, he or she must declare his or her will in the presence of two witnesses and instruct them to have it drawn up as required in the form of a deed.

[3] The witnesses are subject to the same disqualification provisions as apply to wills made in the form of public deeds.

[b. Conversion into deed](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_4/lvl_A/lvl_I/lvl_4/lvl_b) [**Art. 507**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_507) 

[1] The oral will, including the place, day, month and year, must be written down immediately by one of the witnesses, then signed by both and lodged without delay with a judicial authority together with a declaration that the testator was in full possession of his or her testamentary capacity and that he or she informed them of his or her will in the special circumstances prevailing at that time.

[2] The two witnesses may instead have the will recorded by a judicial authority along with the same declaration.

[3] If the testator makes his or her oral will while on military service, an officer with the rank of captain or higher may take the place of the judicial authority.

[**Art. 511**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_511) 

[1] If the testator makes a will without expressly revoking a previous will, the later will supersedes the earlier unless it is manifestly no more than a codicil thereto.

[2] Likewise, a bequest of a specific object is revoked if the testator subsequently makes a new disposition of the same object that is incompatible with the previous disposition.

##### [B. Contracts of succession](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_4/lvl_B)

[**Art. 519**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_519) 

[1] Where contested, a testamentary disposition may be declared invalid:

  
1. if it was made by the testator at a time when he or she lacked testamentary capacity;  
2. if it is the product of a lack of free will;  
3. if its content or a condition attached to it is immoral or unlawful.

[2] An action of declaration of invalidity may be brought by any interested heir or legatee.

###### [II. On grounds of formal defect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 520**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_520) 

[1] If the testamentary disposition is formally defective, it is declared invalid on being contested before a court.

[2] If the formal defect consists in the certain persons being party to the execution of the disposition who or whose family members are beneficiaries under the testamentary disposition, only the clauses relating to those beneficiaries shall be declared invalid.

[3] The right of action is governed by the same provisions as apply in the event of a lack of testamentary capacity.

###### [2. In holographic wills](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_A/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 520***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_520_a)

If the formal defect in a holographic will consists in the day, month or year not being indicated correctly or at all, the will may be declared invalid only if the precise date cannot be ascertained in some other manner and is necessary in order to determine the testator’s testamentary capacity, the chronological order of multiple wills or any other issue affecting the validity of the will.

###### [III. Prescription](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 522**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_522) 

[1] Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom, those heirs who do not receive the full value of their statutory entitlement may sue to have the disposition abated to the permitted amount.

[2] Clauses contained in testamentary dispositions relating to the entitlements of the statutory heirs are deemed merely to be instructions for dividing the estate unless it is evident from the disposition that the testator intended otherwise.

###### [2. Bequests in favour of heirs with a statutory entitlement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_2)

Where a testamentary disposition contains legacies in favour of several heirs with a statutory entitlement and the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom, such legacies shall be abated among the co-heirs in proportion to the amounts by which they exceed each co-heir’s statutory entitlement.

###### [3. Rights of creditors](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I/lvl_3)

[**Art. 524**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_524) 

[1] Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom to the detriment of an heir and the latter fails to bring a action in abatement despite being instructed to do so by the bankruptcy administrators or by creditors holding unpaid debt certificates on succession, the administrators or creditors themselves may bring an action in abatement for the amount necessary to cover their claims within the same time limit that applies to the heir.

[2] The same right applies in the case of a disinheritance not contested by the person disinherited.

###### [II. Effect](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 525**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_525) 

[1] Abatement is applied in equal proportion in respect of all named heirs and legatees unless it is evident from the disposition that the testator intended otherwise.

[2] Where the abatement applies to a legacy whose beneficiary is also the obligor of other legacies, subject to the same proviso such beneficiary may request that those other legacies be abated proportionately.

###### [2. On specific legacies](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[**Art. 526**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_526) 

Where a specific legacy that cannot be divided without loss of value is to be abated, the legatee may either claim it and pay the balance or claim the disposable amount in lieu of the object.

###### [3. On dispositions inter vivos](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3)

The following are subject to abatement in the same manner as testamentary dispositions:

  
1. advances against a person’s share of an inheritance made in the form of wedding gifts, settlements or assignments of assets, to the extent these are not subject to hotchpot;  
2. compensation payments in settlement of future rights of inheritance;  
3. gifts that were freely revocable by the deceased or made in the five years prior to his or her death, with the exception of customary occasional gifts;  
4. assets alienated by the deceased with the obvious intention of circumventing the limitations on his or her testamentary freedom.

[b. Restitution](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_3/lvl_b) [**Art. 528**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_528) 

[1] A person acting in good faith has a duty of restitution only to the extent that he or she is still enriched by such transactions with the deceased at the time of succession.

[2] Where benefits conferred under a contract of succession are subject to abatement, the beneficiary is entitled to reclaim a proportionate amount of the counter-performance made to the testator.

###### [4. On assurance claims](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

[**Art. 529**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_529) 

Where a life assurance claim maturing on the death of the deceased was established in favour of a third party by a disposition inter vivos or by a testamentary disposition or was transferred by the deceased during his or her lifetime to a third party without valuable consideration, such claim is subject to abatement at its redemption value.

###### [5. On usufruct and annuities](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_5)

[**Art. 530**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_530) 

If the testator has encumbered the estate with rights of usufruct and annuities such that their capitalised value over their probable duration exceeds the disposable part of the estate, the heirs are entitled either to seek proportionate abatement of such rights or to redeem them by surrendering the disposable part of the estate to the beneficiaries.

###### [6. On naming of remaindermen](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_6)

[**Art. 531**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_531)

The naming of a remainderman in respect of an heir entitled to a statutory entitlement is invalid as to that part of the estate; the provision on issue who are incapable of judgement is reserved.

###### [III. Order of abatement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_1/tit_14/chap_6/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

[1] Where a person has been declared presumed dead, before his or her heirs or legatees succeed to the estate, they must furnish security for the restitution of the property to those with a prevailing claim or to the missing person himself.

[2] Such security shall be furnished for five years in the case of disappearance in life-threatening circumstances and for 15 years in the case of absence without sign of life, but never beyond the date on which the missing person would have become 100 years old.

[1] If it is impossible to determine whether an heir is alive or dead when succession commences because he or she has disappeared, his or her share of the inheritance is placed under official administration.

[2] Those who would succeed to the missing heir’s share if he or she were dead may request the court to declare the heir presumed dead one year after his or her disappearance in life-threatening circumstances or five years after the last sign of life and, once such declaration has been made, may apply for release of their shares of his or her inheritance.

[3] Such shares are released according to the provisions governing release to the heirs of persons presumed dead.

[1] Where the missing person’s property or succession rights have been under official administration for ten years or more, or he or she would have reached the age of 100, at the request of the competent authority the declaration of presumed death is pronounced *ex officio*.

[2] If no rightful heirs come forward during the public notice period, the property of the person presumed dead passes to the state authority with right to succeed or, if he or she was never resident in Switzerland, to the canton of origin.

[3] The local authority or canton concerned has the same duty of restitution as those put in possession of the estate towards the person presumed dead and parties with prevailing claims.

[**Art. 562**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_562) 

[1] The legatees have a personal claim against the obligors of their legacies or, where no-one is specifically named as such, against the legal or named heirs.

[2] Unless otherwise provided by testamentary disposition, the claim becomes due once the obligor has accepted the inheritance or is no longer able to disclaim it.

[3] If the heirs fail to fulfil their obligation, they may be sued for release of the bequeathed property or, where the legacy pertains to performance of some action, for damages.

###### [2. Object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_3/part_2/tit_16/chap_2/lvl_A/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

[1] Any disposition affecting an object also applies to its accessories, unless an exception is made.

[2] Accessories are those chattels which, according to local custom or the clear will of the main object's owner, permanently facilitate the management, use or preservation of the main object and are auxiliary thereto by virtue of having been joined to it, adapted to it or otherwise connected with it.

[3] If an object is an accessory, it remains so regardless of temporary separation from the main object.

###### [2. Exclusions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_2)

[2] Unless otherwise stipulated, they are co-owners in equal measure.

[3] Each co-owner has the rights and obligations of ownership in respect of his or her share in the object, and said share may be alienated and pledged by him or her, or distrained by his or her creditors.

###### [2. Use and administration rules](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_2)

[1bis] Any amendment to the provisions of the use and administration rules on the allocation of exclusive rights of use also requires the consent of the co-owners who are directly affected.

[2] Such rules cannot annul or restrict the rights of each co-owner:

  
1. to request such measures as are necessary to preserve the object’s value and serviceability and, where required, to have these ordered by a court;  
2. to take, on his or her own initiative and at the expense of all co-owners, such measures as are urgently needed to safeguard the object against imminent or incremental damage.

###### [3. Ordinary administration](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_3)

[2] With the consent of the majority of the co-owners, the authority to carry out administration may be submitted to a different regime, subject to the statutory provisions governing necessary and urgent measures.

###### [4. Major administrative acts](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_4)

[1] Renovations and refurbishments aimed at enhancing the value or improving the object’s profitability or serviceability require the approval of a majority of the co-owners together representing a majority share in the object.

[2] Alterations which permanently hinder or render unprofitable a co-owner’s use or exploitation of the object for its existing purpose may not be carried out without the consent of that co-owner.

[3] Where an alteration would require a co-owner to bear unreasonable costs, in particular because they are disproportionate to the value of his or her share, the alteration may be carried out without his or her consent only if the other co-owners assume such part of his or her share of the costs as exceeds that which he or she may reasonably be expected to meet.

###### [c. Works to improve appearance or convenience](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_5/lvl_c)

[2] If such works are commissioned with the consent of the majority of the co-owners who also represent a majority share in the object, they may be carried out even against the wishes of a dissenting co-owner providing they do not permanently impair the latter’s right of use and enjoyment and the other co-owners compensate him or her for the merely temporary impairment and assume his or her share of the costs.

###### [6. Power of disposal over the object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_6)

[1] Each co-owner is entitled to represent, use and exploit the object insofar as is compatible with the rights of the other co-owners.

[2] The alienation or encumbrance of the object and the modification of its designated purpose require the consent of all co-owners, unless they have unanimously agreed some other arrangement.

[3] Where mortgage rights or real burdens apply to co-ownership shares, the co-owners are not permitted to further encumber the object itself with such charges.

###### [7. Costs and expenses](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_7)

[1] Except where otherwise provided, the administrative costs, taxes and other expenses arising from co-ownership or in relation to the object in co-ownership are borne by the co-owners in proportion to their shares.

[2] If a co-owner has borne more than his or her fair share of such costs, he or she is entitled to compensation from the others to an equivalent extent.

###### [8. Binding nature of rules and noting in the land register](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_8)

The use and administration rules agreed by the co-owners, their administrative decisions and all relevant court judgments and orders are also binding on a co-owner’s legal successor and on any person acquiring a right in rem to a co-ownership share.

[2] They may be noted next to co-ownership shares of immovable property in the land register.

###### [9. Exclusion from collective ownership](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_9)

[1] A co-owner may be excluded from the community of co-owners by court order if, as a result of his or her conduct or that of persons to whom he or she granted use of the object or for whom he or she is responsible, his or her duties towards the other co-owners individually or collectively are so seriously violated that continuation of the community of co-owners becomes unreasonable.

[2] Where the community comprises only two co-owners, each has the right to sue the other; in other cases, unless otherwise agreed, legal action against one co-owner must be authorised by a majority of all the co-owners excluding the person to be sued.

[3] If the court rules in favour of excluding the defendant, it shall order him or her to alienate his or her share and, should he or she fail to do so within the allowed time limit, shall order it to be sold at public auction in accordance with the provisions governing the forced sale of land to the exclusion of the provisions governing dissolution of co-ownership.

###### [b. Further entitled persons](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_9/lvl_b)

[2] Dissolution may be excluded for a maximum of 50 years by means of an agreement which, where the object is land, is valid only if done as a public deed and which may be entered under priority notice in the land register.

[3] Dissolution may not be requested at an inopportune time.

###### [b. Form of partition](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_10/lvl_b)

[**Art. 651**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_651) 

[1] Dissolution is effected by means of physical division, by private sale or sale at auction and division of the sale proceeds, or by transfer of the entire object to one or more co-owners who buy out the others.

[2] If the co-owners are unable to agree on the method of dissolution, the court will order the physical division of the object or, where this is impossible without substantially diminishing its value, its sale at public auction or private auction among the co-owners.

[3] Physical division giving rise to unequal shares may entail monetary payments to balance out the shares.

###### [c. Animals kept as pets](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_18/lvl_C/lvl_I/lvl_10/lvl_c)

[1] A parcel of land may be linked to another parcel of land such that the owner of the main parcel of land is also the owner of the attached parcel of land. The attached parcel shares the same legal destiny as the main parcel and may not be alienated, pledged or encumbered separately.

[2] If the parcels are linked for a permanent purpose, the statutory right of pre-emption of the co-owners and the right to demand dissolution may not be claimed.

[1] If new exploitable land is formed from previously ownerless land as a result of alluvion, filling or ground displacement, changes in the course or level of public waters or in some other manner, such land belongs to the canton in which it lies.

[2] The cantons are free to allocate such land to owners of adjoining land.

[3] If a person can show that parts of ground have become detached from his or her property, he or she is entitled to take them back within an appropriate period.

###### [4. Ground displacement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4)

[1] Ground displacement from one parcel of land to another does not alter the boundaries of the parcels.

[2] Earth and other objects moving from one parcel to the other in the process are subject to the provisions governing driftage or the joining and mixing of chattels.

[b. Constant ground displacement](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_b) [**Art. 660***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_660_a)

[1] The general principle whereby ground displacement does not alter land boundaries does not apply to areas designated by the cantons as being in permanent danger of ground displacement.

[2] When designating such areas, due consideration shall be given to the characteristics of the land in question.

[3] Where a parcel of land forms part of such an area, this fact must be notified in an appropriate manner to the interested parties and recorded in the land register.

[c. Redrawing of boundaries](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_1/lvl_B/lvl_I_I/lvl_4/lvl_c) [**Art. 660***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_660_b)

[1] Where a landowner does not have adequate access from his or her land to a public thoroughfare, he or she has the right to require his or her neighbours to grant him or her the necessary right of way in exchange for full compensation.

[2] This right is in the first place exercised against the neighbour who, in the light of existing ownership and access circumstances, may most reasonably be expected to grant such right of way, and secondly in respect of the neighbour for whom it is least damaging.

[3] When determining the route of a right of way, the interests of both parties must be taken into consideration.

[b. Other rights of way](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_II_I/lvl_7/lvl_b) [**Art. 695**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_695)

[1] If objects are carried onto another parcel of land by water, wind, avalanche or other force of nature or by chance event, or if animals such as livestock, swarms of bees, poultry and fish stray onto his or her property, the landowner must grant the rightful owner access to his or her land to search for and retrieve them.

[2] The landowner is entitled to claim damages for any damage caused and to that end has a special lien as to such objects and animals.

###### [3. Trespass to ward off danger or damage](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_2/lvl_B/lvl_I_V/lvl_3)

Landowners who choose not to participate in the decision-making process are deemed to consent. Participation is recorded in the land register.

[2] The cantons regulate the procedure. In particular, they must issue detailed rules on consolidation of landholdings.

[3] Cantonal legislation may further facilitate the realisation of such land improvements and may declare that the corresponding provisions also apply to building land and to areas designated as being in permanent danger of ground displacement.

[1] If springs and wells that are indispensable for the exploitation or habitation of a parcel of land or for the supply of drinking water are cut off or contaminated, those affected have the right to demand that the status quo ante be restored where at all possible.

[2] In other cases restoration of the status quo ante may be demanded only where this is justified by special circumstances.

###### [IV. Community of spring owners](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_2/lvl_C/lvl_I_V)

[2] The costs of the common installations are borne by the rightful users in proportion to their respective interests.

[3] If one user opposes the request, each user has the right to capture and divert his or her own spring in the normal manner, even if the volume of flow of the other springs is thereby diminished, and is liable to pay compensation only to the extent that his or her own spring is augmented by the new works.

###### [V. Use of springs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_2/lvl_C/lvl_V)

[**Art. 712***a*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_a) 

[1] Condominium is a form of co-ownership of immovable property that gives the co-owner the exclusive right to make sole use of specific parts of a building thereon and design the interior of such parts.

[2] Each condominium owner is free to manage, use and design the structure of his or her own parts of the building as he or she wishes but must not obstruct any other condominium owners in the exercise of their own rights or in any way damage the common parts of the building, fittings and installations or impair their functional effectiveness or appearance.

[3] Each condominium owner is obliged to maintain his or her parts of the building in the manner required to preserve the sound condition and good appearance of the building as a whole.

###### [II. Object](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 712***b*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_b) 

[1] The object of the exclusive right may be individual storeys or parts of a storey which must be self-contained with their own access and used either as dwellings or as self-contained units of rooms used for business or other purposes, although separate ancillary rooms are allowed.

[2] The condominium owner may not be granted an exclusive right to the following:

  
1. the land on which the building stands and the building right by virtue of which it is constructed;  
2. the parts of the building that are vital to the soundness, structure and stability of the building as a whole or of the units of other condominium owners or that determine the outward form and appearance of the building;  
3. the fittings and installations that also serve the other condominium owners in the use of their units.

[3] The deed of constitution or a subsequent agreement among the condominium owners executed in the same form may stipulate that other parts of the building are common property, failing which they are presumed to be the object of a exclusive right.

###### [III. Power of disposal](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_A/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 712***c*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_c) 

[1] Condominium owners do not by law have first right of refusal in respect of a third party acquiring a share, but such right may be stipulated in the deed of constitution or by subsequent agreement and entered under priority notice in the land register.

[2] Similarly, it may be stipulated that the alienation, encumbrance with usufruct or right of residence or letting of a unit is valid only if the other co-owners do not object by resolution made within 14 days of receiving notice of such transaction.

[3] The objection is ineffective if made without good cause.

##### [B. Creation and extinction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B)

[**Art. 712***d*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_d) 

[1] Condominium is constituted by entry in the land register.

[2] Such entry may be requested:

  
1. on the basis of an agreement between the condominium owners to constitute their shares as condominium;  
2. on the basis of a declaration by the owner of the property or the holder of a distinct and permanent building right to form shares in co-ownership and to constitute the same as condominium.

[3] In order to be valid, the constitution of condominium must be executed in the form of a public deed or, where provided for in a testamentary disposition or in a contract of division of estate, in the form prescribed by the law of succession.

###### [II. Layout of the condominium units and shares in the property](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 712***e*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_e) 

[1] The deed of constitution must specify the manner in which the property is divided into condominium units and define the share that each unit represents of the value of the property or of the building right expressed as fractions with a common denominator.

[2] Alteration of the size of a share requires the consent of all directly involved parties and the approval of the assembly of condominium owners; however, each condominium owner is entitled to seek rectification if his or her share has been defined incorrectly in error or is no longer accurate owing to structural modifications to the building or its surroundings.

###### [III. Extinction](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_B/lvl_II_I)

[**Art. 712***f*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_f) 

[1] Condominium is extinguished on the loss of the property or the building right and its deletion from the land register.

[2] Such deletion may be requested in accordance with a termination agreement or by a single condominium owner holding all the shares, but it requires the consent of all persons with rights in rem to the individual units which cannot be transferred to the property as a whole without detriment.

[3] Any condominium owner may request termination of the condominium where:

  
1. more than half the value of the building has been destroyed and reconstruction would impose an onerous burden on him; or  
2. the building has been divided into condominium units for more than 50 years and can no longer be used in accordance with the regulations due to its poor structural condition.

4 Condominium owners wishing to maintain the condominium may prevent such termination by buying out the others.

##### [C. Administration and use](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_C)

[**Art. 712***g*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_g) 

[1] The provisions governing co-ownership regulate the authority to take administrative action and instruct construction work.

[2] Except where such provisions are mandatory, they may be replaced by others set out in the deed of constitution or adopted by unanimous resolution of the assembly of condominium owners.

[3] Moreover, each condominium owner is entitled to request that a set of rules governing administration and use be drawn up and noted in the land register, such rules being binding once accepted by resolution passed by a majority of the condominium owners who together represent more than one-half of the property and being subject to amendment by the same majority even if included in the deed of constitution.

[4] Any amendment to the allocation of exclusive rights of use in accordance with the regulations shall also require the consent of the condominium owners directly affected.

###### [II. Communal charges and costs](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_C/lvl_I_I)

[**Art. 712***h*](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_712_h) 

[1] The condominium owners bear the charges in relation to the communal parts of the property and the costs of joint administration in proportion to the value of their shares.

[2] In particular, such charges and costs include:

  
1. regular maintenance, repairs and renovations of the communal parts of the parcel of land and the building and shared fittings and installations;  
2. administration, including remuneration of the administrator;  
3. public duties and taxes imposed collectively on the co-owners;  
4. interest and capital repayments to lenders to whom the property is pledged or to whom the condominium owners are jointly and severally liable.

[3] Where specific parts of the building, fittings or installations are of little or no benefit to certain condominium owners, the allocation of shared costs must take this into account.

###### [2. Liability for cost contributions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_1/tit_19/chap_3/lvl_C/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[2] If a tenant or other person with rights to the property is liable for debts due to tradesmen or building contractors, the claim is valid only if the property owner has consented to the work being done.

3 The beneficiary may not waive such statutory mortgage rights in advance.

###### [2. Vendor, co‑heirs and co‑owners](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_2/tit_22/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_2)

[1] A tradesman's or building contractor’s lien may be recorded in the land register as of the date of his or her undertaking to perform work.

[2] Application for such entry must be made within four months of completion of the work.

[3] The lien is entered only if the claim has been acknowledged by the owner or confirmed in a court judgment and may not be requested if the owner provides the claimant with adequate security.

[4] If the property is indisputably administrative assets and if the owner's liability for the debt is not based on contractual obligations, the owner shall be liable to the tradesmen or building contractor for debts that are acknowledged or determined by a court in accordance with the provisions on a debt subject to a simple surety, provided a written claim for the debt making reference to the statutory surety was made against the owner no later than four months after completion of the work.

[5] If there is a dispute as to whether immovable property constitutes administrative assets, the tradesman or building contractor may apply for the provisional recording of the lien in the land register no later than four months after completion of the work.

[6] If it is held in a court judgment that the immovable property constitutes administrative assets, the provisional recording of the lien must be deleted. It shall be replaced by the statutory surety provided the requirements of paragraph 4 are met. The deadline is met with the provisional recording of the lien.

[c. Privileged claim](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#book_4/part_2/tit_22/chap_2/lvl_D/lvl_I_I/lvl_3/lvl_c) [**Art. 841**](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en#art_841) 

[1] Where the claims of tradesmen and building contractors are not wholly satisfied by foreclosure, the shortfall must be compensated for by the higher-ranking creditors out of such portion of the proceeds as exceeds the land value, provided it is apparent to such creditors that their liens have encumbered the property to the detriment of the tradesmen and building contractors.

[2] If the higher-ranking creditor alienates his or her mortgage security, he or she must compensate the tradesmen and building contractors for any sum of which they are deprived by such alienation.

[3] Once an interested party has had the beginning of the work noted in the land register, until the time limit for registration has expired, liens may only be registered in the form of mortgage contracts.
